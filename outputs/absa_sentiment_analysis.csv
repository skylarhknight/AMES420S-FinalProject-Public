View all partners Do you ever think about the digital footprint you leave when you are browsing the web, shopping online, commenting on social networks or going by a facial recognition camera?  State surveillance of citizens is growing all over the world, but it is a fact of everyday life in China, where it has deep historical roots. In China, almost nothing is paid for in cash anymore. Super apps make life easy: people use Alipay or WeChat Pay to pay for subway or bus tickets, rent a bike, hail a taxi, shop online, book trains and shows, split the bill at restaurants and even pay their taxes and utility bills.  The Chinese also use these platforms to check the news, entertain themselves and exchange countless text, audio and video messages, both personal and professional. Everything is linked to the user’s mobile phone number, which is itself registered under their identity. The government may access the data collected by Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi and other operators.  Much has been written about blacklists (listing authors of “trust-breaking” behaviours, such as not settling one’s debts), redlists (listing authors of commendable behaviours, such as volunteering) and commercial and public “social credit” systems. However, recent research has shown that these systems are still fragmented and scattered in terms of data collection and analysis. They  also rely at least partly on manual rather than digitized or algorithmic processes, with little capacity to build integrated citizen profiles through compiling all the available data. How do Chinese citizens experience this constant surveillance? In my book Living with Digital Surveillance in China: Citizens’ Narratives on Technology, Privacy and Governance, I present research I conducted in China in 2019. Specifically, the book is based on 58 semi-structured in-depth interviews with Chinese participants recruited through colleagues at three universities in Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu. Like my colleagues Genia Kostka and Chuncheng Liu, I discovered that many participants in my research frame surveillance as indispensable for solving China’s problems.  Underpinning this support is a coherent system of anguishing narratives, to which  redemptive narratives respond. The anguishing narratives emphasise the moral shortcomings that the research participants attribute to China: almost every participant brought up the “lack of moral quality” of their fellow citizens, whom they said behaved like children with little moral sense.  In the context of this shame-inducing narrative, surveillance is framed as a welcome solution to enforce the rules by punishing violators and getting people to behave better. According to the participants, moral shortcomings are responsible for the “century of humiliations” that China has experienced since the Opium Wars and the Japanese invasions; according to this discourse, “civilizing” the population will enable China to gain the international recognition it so ardently desires.  Finally, wanting to protect privacy was often seen by participants as a desire to hide shameful secrets in order to save face. Here too, surveillance is viewed positively, as a tool to unmask shady behaviours and promote morality.  These three narratives of shame and fear are countered by two redemptive ones, that serve as an antidote: that of the government as a protective figure, i.e., one that acts like a benevolent parent who guarantees the security and prosperity of its children, and the resolutely techno-optimistic one of technology as a magic bullet where technological advances is credited as the potential to solve all of China’s problems, and as a civilizing force that will propel China towards international recognition.  Yet the people I spoke to also expressed frustration, fear and anger about state surveillance. Almost 90 per cent of them adopted one or more mental tactics to distance, and mentally protect themselves, from surveillance.  In my analysis I identified four different types of tactics: 1 – Brushing surveillance aside Denying or minimizing the existence of surveillance: “Nobody is watching. The government does not want to spend money to pay people to watch all the time. When they need it, they check; otherwise, no one is watching.” Ignoring it: “If I don’t like the loss of privacy and freedom, I choose to ignore it, I don’t think of it.” Or: “Yes, it’s true, but it does not harm me. It does not remind me all the time. Sometimes I choose to ignore it.” Normalizing it: “In China everyone shares their credit card information, their address, their ID. We feel secure.”; “Most governments use social media as a tool to spy.” Redefining restrictions as temporary, or as occurring less than in the past, or less for oneself than for others, such as civil servants. Some redefine freedom itself: “It’s the country that makes the laws, the regulations, it’s like that in all countries. Other behaviours are a matter of my freedom, for example what I’m going to have for lunch.” 2 – Othering surveillance targets Because I’m just an ordinary citizen: “I’m not a big potato, there’s no need for people to intentionally find me.” Or because I’m a good person and “the blacklist is just for criminals”: “We think that improving public behaviour will make the environment and surroundings better for us, for the ones who obey the rules in the first place.” 3 – Wearing blinders By focusing on everyday life: “Most people don’t care about these things. They care about money and power.” Or, by  focusing on the present: “We can’t live without Zhifu [Alipay], or Didi. We have facial recognition, CCTV is everywhere. It won’t harm me at present, so far, it does not do actual harm, so I’m not that concerned.” 4 – Resorting to fatalism “Nobody can avoid it… I don’t know how to avoid this risk, I just accept it.”; “We think it’s useless to spend time discussing the social credit system since we can’t change it.” In short, the way the Chinese citizens I spoke to experience digital surveillance is characterized by strong psychic tensions: the same persons who support surveillance as being indispensable in the Chinese context are also and nevertheless expressing the heavy burden that coping with such exposure places on them.  This weight is both cognitive, as evidenced by the range of self-protective  mental tactics to dissociate oneself from surveillance, and emotional, as conveyed in participants’ strong emotions and particularly telling body language. So, what about us? We, in Western liberal democracies, are also exposed to digital surveillance. And our surveillance ideas are also shaped by our own socio-political, cultural, and economic contexts, with significant variations across different Western societies. My work suggests that some of our own privacy and surveillance narratives are quite close to the Chinese ones, while others clearly differ.  What about you? How do you see your own relationship to digital surveillance? This article was originally published in French This article was originally published in French

(Photo by Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) In China, the government’s expansive surveillance system has long been a tool for maintaining control, a sprawling network designed to monitor the activities of over 1.4 billion citizens. Advanced technologies like facial recognition cameras, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics are embedded into daily life, ensuring that almost no action goes unnoticed. Yet, this unprecedented surveillance network is now revealing cracks—cracks that are being exploited by the very people tasked with maintaining it. In what might seem like a plot twist in a dystopian novel, insiders within China’s surveillance apparatus have found ways to profit from the system, Wired reports. These government employees and contractors, with privileged access to the vast treasure troves of personal information, are selling this data on the black market. Sensitive details such as real-time locations, banking records, and passport scans are now being peddled on platforms like Telegram. Some of this data is sold for just a few dollars, while more comprehensive profiles command higher prices, paid in cryptocurrencies to ensure anonymity. China’s surveillance state is unrivaled in its reach. With an estimated over 700 million cameras installed across the country, many equipped with facial recognition, every public space is potentially a site of monitoring. Mobile apps used daily by millions—such as WeChat and Alipay—are tied directly to government databases, tracking transactions, communications, and movement. Even the Social Credit System, a hallmark of China’s control measures, uses this data to reward or penalize citizens based on their behavior. From urban centers to rural villages, the system touches every corner of Chinese life. Officially, it is framed as a necessity for public safety and political stability. Yet, the staggering amount of data collected has created a tempting resource for those with access—and questionable motives. The rise of this black market lays bare a paradox at the heart of China’s surveillance state. Built to tighten the government’s grip on its population, the system is being turned against its creators, used to undermine the very control it was meant to enforce. Citizens who might have trusted—or at least resigned themselves to—the surveillance network now find their personal information being sold to the highest bidder. The implications go beyond China’s borders. Data theft knows no national boundaries, and the leaked information often finds its way into global criminal networks. For individuals and organizations outside of China, the potential consequences are just as severe, as Chinese surveillance data increasingly feeds into international cybercrime ecosystems. The exploitation of China’s surveillance system is a stark reminder that no data, no matter how secure it seems, is entirely safe. While the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, has built one of the most intrusive monitoring networks in the world, its failure to prevent insiders from monetizing this system reveals a critical vulnerability. For all its technological sophistication, the system’s reliance on human operators has become its Achilles’ heel. As China expands its surveillance capabilities, it faces a growing challenge: how to maintain the integrity of its data infrastructure while addressing internal corruption. Without meaningful reform, the cycle of data exploitation will likely continue, eroding public trust and exposing millions of citizens to harm.",9,2,0,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Artificial Intelligence  
Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technology Initiative  Across the Chinese government’s surveillance apparatus, its many arms are busy collecting huge volumes of data. Video surveillance footage, WeChat accounts, e-commerce data, medical history, and hotel records: It’s all fair game for the government’s surveillance regime. Yet, taken individually, each of these data streams don’t tell authorities very much. That’s why the Chinese government has embarked on a massive project of data fusion, which merges disparate datasets to produce data-driven analysis. This is how Chinese surveillance systems achieve what authorities call “visualization” (可视化) and “police informatization” (警务信息化).  While policymakers around the world have grown increasingly aware of China’s mass surveillance regime—from its most repressive practices in Xinjiang to its exports of surveillance platforms to more than 80 countries—relatively little attention has been paid to how Chinese authorities are making use of the data it collects. As countries and companies consider how to respond to China’s surveillance regime, policymakers need to understand data fusion’s crucial role in monitoring the country’s population in order to craft effective responses.   As China’s population has embraced online life, the Party-state’s mass surveillance practices have evolved from relying on more manual methods—such as dānwèi (单位) work units, the hùkǒu (户口) residency registration system, and dǎng’àn (档案) secret political files—to using technologies that range from the mundane to the cutting-edge. To achieve the goal of “stability maintenance” (维稳), China’s national surveillance programs utilize varying degrees of data fusion. Data fusion is present, for example, in national defense crisis response platforms (国防动员) developed in the mid-2010s that gather data from multiple “thematic clouds,” including e-commerce, tourism, industry, courts, and law enforcement. Other recent programs that rely on data fusion include Sharp Eyes (雪亮工程), the nation-wide Police Cloud (警务云), and Xinjiang’s Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP, 一体化联合作战平台).   One of the Chinese government’s most prominent data fusion programs is Sharp Eyes, which was launched in 2015 by nine government bodies. The program builds on the infrastructure used by Skynet—a 2005 initiative that focused on surveillance in urban public areas—and extends it into rural areas. Sharp Eyes pulls from a wide variety of data sources. These include surveillance cameras—both privately and government-owned and with and without facial-recognition capabilities—and vehicle and license plate recognition cameras. Public and private video surveillance systems collect facial and other attributes from key locations such as hospitals, schools, entertainment venues, hotels, internet cafes, major road intersections, and storefronts. Sharp Eyes also aims to collect “virtual identities,” such as MAC addresses, phone numbers, and WeChat accounts.  Authorities ascertain individuals’ identities by first combining the above information with geographic information source (GIS) data and then sending this data to “societal resource integration platforms,” which exist in Xinjiang and at least four other provinces. According to analysis originally published in the journal China Digital Cable TV, a publication supervised by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Science and Technology, these platforms combine facial and vehicle recognition data and match it against private and public video sources. GIS data is superimposed on live video feeds to provide granular location data. Multiple companies can be involved in one platform project. For example, one local Sharp Eyes project in Fujian Province uses products from prominent (and blacklisted) AI companies such as Yitu, Huawei, and Hikvision.   However, Sharp Eyes is not entirely powered by data fusion. In fact, human-centric surveillance is a key design element. In the city of Linyi, where Sharp Eyes was piloted, the local government upgraded citizens’ television cable boxes so they could view surveillance feeds and report crimes by pushing a button on their TV remotes.The Ministry of Justice even provided a patriotic slogan for the effort: “remote control in hand, safety in heart.” (This citizen-centric surveillance strategy originates from the Cultural Revolution, which inspired Sharp Eyes’ name.) As part of Sharp Eyes, mobile apps push video surveillance and public security information to citizens and allow assigned groups of households to report crimes. Command and control centers are staffed by personnel to review footage, take citizens’ reports, and dispatch police accordingly.  Another national program that uses data fusion is the Ministry of Public Security’s (MPS) Police Cloud, which has been active since 2015. Provincial police cloud-computing centers fuse data from public and private sources, including ID cards, CCTV footage, medical history, supermarket memberships, IP addresses, social media usernames, delivery records, residential addresses, hotel stays, petition records, and biometrics, according to a 2017 report from Human Rights Watch. In a nod to “visualizing” data, the system aims to uncover connections between individuals that would otherwise be difficult for police officers to detect on their own. It supposedly predicts future actions or threats that might cause social instability, such as protests and acts of terror.   China’s data-fusion programs allow its surveillance systems to assemble highly detailed portraits of the country’s citizens, but these systems apply particularly severe scrutiny to “focus personnel,” which includes individuals petitioning the government, those purportedly involved in terrorism, and those “undermining social stability.” China’s Uyghur ethnic minority is among those that fall under the “focus personnel” category, and in the Xinjiang region, the center of Uyghur life, this persecuted minority is subjected to intense surveillance.  One key tool in this surveillance regime is the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), which monitors Xinjiang residents with unprecedented intrusiveness. The system flags mundane and otherwise legal behavior as warranting further surveillance, imprisonment, or even extralegal internment in Xinjiang’s vast network of concentration camps. The IJOP functions as a data fusion tool by tying an individual’s government-issued ID card to her physical attributes (such as facial features, blood type, and height), as well as tracking where individuals’ phones, ID cards, and vehicles go. The system collects a variety of data from afar: excessive electricity use, the use of WhatsApp and VPNs, driving someone else’s car. The system also relies on highly intrusive methods. Scattered at strategic locations such as malls and mosques around Xinjiang are what are known as “three-dimensional portrait and integrated data doors” (三维人像综合数据门). These “doors” resemble airport metal detectors and possess facial recognition capabilities, ID card verification, and tools to lift a variety of data from mobile phones, such as MAC addresses, IMEI, IMSI, and ESN numbers. The IJOP also ingests data collected by what have been dubbed “anti-terrorism swords,” which are used at police checkpoints to plug into phones and download their contents, according to an Intercept investigation. IJOP sends push notifications to officers, who can pull aside someone walking through a data door. They can then interrogate individuals and detain or imprison them. In this way, the IJOP can restrict individuals’ movements, which are limited based on what threat level the system determines they fall under.   China’s military is another player using data-fusion tools in Xinjiang to build predictive policing systems. In 2019, a professor named Cui Yinglong at the People’s Armed Police Engineering University in the regional capital of Ürümqi developed a “dynamic early warning” system, known as the Tianshan Anti-terrorism Cloud (天山反恐云). It is trained on a database he helped build called the “East Turkistan terrorist activity database,” which collects and fuses data based on terrorist methods, objectives, attack dates, and organization from 1990 to the present. Although little information exists on the inner workings of the app, it purports to “accurately depict” terrorists’ “religious, organizational, and behavioral characteristics.” The cloud is designed to provide soldiers with early warning of terrorist activity and combat decision support, and is apparently in active operational use.   While it is tempting to conclude that China’s surveillance state is effortlessly and automatically tracking and surveilling every person in the country, its monitoring systems are plagued by human inefficiency, unreliable and incomplete basic data, and incompatible datasets and systems. These inefficiencies have resulted in data silos, also known as “government information islands” (政府信息孤岛), a phrase that refers to isolated data pools that are not adequately shared within government bureaucracies. Currently, data is shared horizontally (across departments and regions) and vertically (within the same organizational entity from the local level up). But scholars have found that horizontal integration bodies suffer from a lack of information that is stove-piped in vertical bodies. As a result, authorities are hindered by bureaucratic systems that prevent more comprehensive data access and greater insight.   To better execute data fusion, Chinese authorities are now attempting to tackle longstanding issues with data silos, according to a recent ChinaFile analysis of government procurement notices. In 2019, for example, authorities in Beijing looked to build a “Sharp Eyes Video Sharing and Exchange Platform” that would make available video footage from cameras belonging to a range of different departments on a single platform. By integrating footage from approximately 200,000 cameras—and up to 1 million—the platform would improve access to footage and data re-use. To further improve data fusion, future improvements to Sharp Eyes include implementing a standard data mining approach and overcoming technical difficulties and inconsistent standards.   On the legal front, authorities have also taken several steps to address data silos. While some of this reform preceded the advent of surveillance programs such as Sharp Eyes and the IJOP, scholars Huirong Chen and Sheena Chestnut Greitens note that newer reforms under Xi Jinping coincided with these programs. They include the 2017–18 reorganization of the People’s Armed Police and passing the 2017 National Intelligence Law, which aimed to integrate disparate intelligence and national security authorities. Furthermore, the 13th Five-Year Plan for National Informatization (2016–2020) detailed issues with “information islands,” and called for integrating systems across ministries and departments. In 2017, the Party asked local governments to establish comprehensive information platforms, likely similar to the ones established under Sharp Eyes.  Responding to the Chinese government’s use of data-fusion systems to power its surveillance systems represents a difficult challenge. Under the Trump Administration, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) blacklisted multiple Chinese companies for their human rights abuses in Xinjiang, adding them to the so-called “Entity List.” By being added to the Entity List, these firms should have been cut off from U.S. suppliers, but given the opaque nature of supply chains, it is difficult to assess whether sanctioned firms have been able to access U.S.-originating technologies via workarounds. It also difficult to assess whether homegrown R&D initiatives to develop domestic alternatives to U.S. goods have borne fruit. Furthermore, the vast majority of the companies on the Entity List do not have data fusion as their main line of business; rather, they often provide services that feed into fusion architectures. This means U.S. policy is potentially overlooking a key area of Chinese surveillance systems. (Media and nongovernmental organizations have created lists of Chinese and non-Chinese companies that enable surveillance data fusion practices. This database can aid the BIS in making determinations for its Entity List.)  On the technical side, governmental organizations, such as the National Science Foundation and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, can fund research to thwart data fusion processes. One emerging line of research seeks to develop privacy-preserving computer vision systems that obscure individuals’ faces. Other lines of research seek to build counter-surveillance technologies, such as specialized clothing, attacking systems through adversarial examples (intentionally destructive inputs to cause model malfunctioning), or data poisoning (modifying training images). Interfering at the stage prior to fusion would not only protect the privacy of those targeted by surveillance systems, but also prevent data fusion processes from accurately functioning.   It is also important to look at the role of U.S. companies. Chinese surveillance systems are heavily reliant on U.S. firms to provide the gear that powers these digital operations. U.S. suppliers such as Intel, NVIDIA, Cisco, Seagate and Western Digital have all been linked to various aspects of Chinese surveillance systems, but the U.S. government has so far been unable to write rules effectively prohibiting the sales of such equipment. In 2020, the State Department released exhaustive guidance for companies’ export considerations, but the document is nonbinding. The difficulty of imposing binding rules against U.S. companies—along with the continued synergy between the commercial sphere and surveillance states’ technical needs—makes it difficult to prevent the export of such technology. As the United States has staked out a clear policy against surveillance-enabled repression, especially in Xinjiang, it is no longer acceptable for companies to deny knowledge of involvement in supporting China’s surveillance state. One of the most viable options to decrease companies’ more problematic exports remains increased public pressure.  Increased attention to Chinese data fusion practices—and its supporting companies—would allow U.S. policy to target China’s surveillance state at a core level, rather than only facial and voice recognition elements that feed into fusion architectures. Taking such steps would better protect Uyghurs, “focus personnel,” and the Chinese people writ large from falling under increasingly abusive, unchecked surveillance.   Dahlia Peterson is a research analyst at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology.   Intel provides financial support to the Brookings Institution, a nonprofit organization devoted to rigorous, independent, in-depth public policy research.  The Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.

Western,https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/10/10/1060982/china-pandemic-cameras-surveillance-state-book/,-1.557376178162296,"The authors of ""Surveillance State"" discuss what the West misunderstands about Chinese state control and whether the invasive trajectory of surveillance tech can still be reversed. It’s no surprise that last week, when the Biden administration updated its list of Chinese military companies blocked from accessing US technologies, it added Dahua. The second-largest surveillance camera company in the world, just after Hikvision, Dahua sells to over 180 countries. It exemplifies how Chinese companies have leapfrogged to the front of the video surveillance industry and have driven the world, especially China, to adopt more surveillance tech. Over the past decade, the US—and the world more generally—have watched with a growing sense of alarm as China has emerged as a global leader in this space. Indeed, the Chinese government has been at the forefront of exploring ways to apply cutting-edge research in computer vision, the Internet of Things, and hardware manufacturing in day-to-day governance. This has led to a slew of human rights abuses—notably, and perhaps most brutally, in monitoring Muslim ethnic minorities in the Western region of Xinjiang. At the same time, the state has also used surveillance tech for good: to find abducted children, for example, and to improve traffic control and trash management in populous cities. As Wall Street Journal reporters Josh Chin and Liza Lin argue in their new book Surveillance State, out last month, the Chinese government has managed to build a new social contract with its citizens: they give up their data in exchange for more precise governance that, ideally, makes their lives safer and easier (even if it doesn’t always work out so simply in reality).    MIT Technology Review recently spoke with Chin and Lin about the five years of reporting that culminated in the book, exploring the misconception that privacy is not valued in China. “A lot of the foreign media coverage, when they encountered that [question], would just brush it off as ‘Oh, Chinese people just don’t have the concept of privacy … they’re brainwashed into accepting it,’” says Chin. “And we felt it was too easy of a conclusion for us, so we wanted to dig into it.” When they did, they realized that the perception of privacy is actually more pliable than it often appears.  We also spoke about how the pandemic has accelerated the use of surveillance tech in China, whether the technology itself can stay neutral, and the extent to which other countries are following China’s lead.  How the world should respond to the rise of surveillance states “might be one of the most important questions facing global politics at the moment,” Chin says, “because these technologies … really do have the potential to completely alter the way governments interact with and control people.”  Here are the key takeaways from our conversation with Josh Chin and Liza Lin. After decades of double-digit GDP growth, China’s economic boom has slowed down over the past three years and is expected to face even stronger headwinds. (The World Bank currently estimates that China’s 2022 annual GDP growth will decrease to 2.8%.) So the old social contract, which promised better returns from an economy steered by an authoritarian government, is strained—and a new one is needed.  As Chin and Lin observe, the Chinese government is now proposing that by collecting every Chinese citizen’s data extensively, it can find out what the people want (without giving them votes) and build a society that meets their needs.  But to sell this to its people—who, like others around the world, are increasingly aware of the importance of privacy—China has had to cleverly redefine that concept, moving from an individualistic understanding to a collectivist one. Hikvision could be sanctioned for aiding the Chinese government’s human rights violations in Xinjiang. Here’s everything you need to know. The idea of privacy itself is “an incredibly confusing and malleable concept,” says Chin. “In US law, there’s a dozen, if not more, definitions of privacy. And I think the Chinese government grasped that and sensed an opportunity to define privacy in ways that not only didn’t undermine the surveillance state but actually reinforced it.”  What the Chinese government has done is position the state and citizens on the same side of the privacy battle against private companies. Consider recent Chinese legislation like the Personal Information Protection Law (in effect since November 2021) and the Data Security Law (since September 2021), under which private companies face harsh penalties for allowing security breaches or failing to get user consent for data collection. State actors, however, largely get a pass under these laws. “Cybersecurity hacks and data leaks happen not just to companies. They happen to government agencies, too,” says Lin. “But with something like that, you never hear state media play it up at all.” Enabled by its censorship machine, the Chinese government has often successfully directed people’s fury over privacy violations away from the government and entirely toward private companies.  When Chin and Lin were planning the book, they envisioned ending with a thought experiment about what would happen to surveillance tech if something like 9/11 happened again. Then the pandemic came.  And just like 9/11, the coronavirus fast-tracked the global surveillance industry, the authors saw—particularly in China. Chin and Lin report on the striking parallels between the way China used societal security to justify the surveillance regime it built in Xinjiang and the way it used physical safety to justify the overreaching pandemic control tools. “In the past, it was always a metaphorical virus: ‘someone was infected with terrorist ideas,’” says Lin. In Xinjiang, before the pandemic, the term “virus” was used in internal government documents to describe what the state deemed “Islamic radicalism.” “But with covid,” she says, “we saw China really turn the whole state surveillance apparatus against its entire population and against a virus that was completely invisible and contagious.” Going back to the idea that the perception of privacy can change greatly depending on the circumstances, the pandemic has also provided the exact context in which ordinary citizens may agree to give up more of their privacy in the name of safety. “In the field of public health, disease surveillance has never been controversial, because of course you would want to track a disease in the way it spreads. Otherwise how do you control it?” says Chin. “They probably saved millions of lives by using those technologies,” he says, “and the result is that sold [the necessity of] state surveillance to a lot of Chinese people.” Once someone (or some entity) starts using surveillance tech, the downward slope is extremely slippery: no matter how noble the motive for developing and deploying it, the tech can always be used for more malicious purposes. For Chin and Lin, China shows how the “good” and “bad” uses of surveillance tech are always intertwined. They report extensively on how a surveillance system in Hangzhou, the city that’s home to Alibaba, Hikvision, Dahua, and many other tech companies, was built on the benevolent premise of improving city management. Here, with a dense network of cameras on the street and a cloud-based “city brain” processing data and giving out orders, the “smart city” system is being used to monitor disasters and enable quick emergency responses. In one notable example, the authors talk to a man who accompanied his mother to the hospital in an ambulance in 2019 after she nearly drowned. The city was able to turn all the traffic lights on their path to reduce the time it took to reach the hospital. It’s impossible to argue this isn’t a good use of the technology. But at the same time, it has come to a point where the “smart city” technologies are almost indistinguishable from “safe city” technologies, which aim to enhance police forces and track down alleged criminals. The surveillance company Hikvision, which partly powers the lifesaving system in Hangzhou, is the same one that facilitated the massive incarceration of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.  China is far from the only country where police are leaning on a growing number of cameras. Chin and Lin highlight how police in New York City have used and abused cameras to build a facial recognition database and identify suspects, sometimes with legally questionable tactics. (MIT Technology Review also reported earlier this year on how the police in Minnesota built a database to surveil protesters and journalists.) Chin argues that given this track record, the tech itself can no longer be considered neutral. “Certain technologies by their nature lend themselves to harmful uses. Particularly with AI applied to surveillance, they lend themselves to authoritarian outcomes,” he says. And just like nuclear researchers, for instance, scientists and engineers in these areas should be more careful about the technology’s potential harm. There is a sense of pessimism when talking about how surveillance tech will advance in China, because the invasive implementation has become so widespread that it’s hard to imagine the country reversing course.  But that doesn’t mean people should give up. One key way to intervene, Chin and Lin argue, is to cut off the global supply chain of surveillance tech (a network MIT Technology Review wrote about just last month). The development of surveillance technology has always been a global effort, with many American companies participating. The authors recount how American companies like Intel and Cisco were essential in building the bedrock of China’s surveillance system. And they were able to disclaim their own responsibility by saying they simply didn’t know what the end use of their products would be. That kind of excuse won’t work as easily in the future, because global tech companies are being held to higher standards. Whether they contributed to human rights violations on the opposite side of the globe “has become a thing that companies are worried about and planning around,” Chin says. “That’s a really interesting shift that we haven’t seen in decades.”  Some of these companies have stopped working with China or have been replaced by Chinese firms that have developed similar technologies, but that doesn’t mean China has a self-sufficient surveillance system now. The supply chain for surveillance technology is still distributed around the world, and Chinese tech companies require parts from the US or other Western countries to continue building their products.  The main example here is the GPU, a type of processor originally produced to run better-quality video games that has since been used to power mass surveillance systems. China still relies for these on foreign companies like Nvidia, which is headquartered in California.  “In the last two years, there’s been a huge push to substitute foreign technology with domestic technology, [but] these are the areas [where] they still can’t achieve independence,” Lin says. This means the West can still try to slow the development of the Chinese surveillance state by putting pressure on industry. But results will depend on how much political will there is to uncover the key links in surveillance supply chains, and to come up with effective responses.  “The other really important thing is just to strengthen your own democratic institutions … like a free press and a strong and vibrant civil society space,” says Lin. Because China won't be the only country with the potential to become a surveillance state. It can happen anywhere, they warn, including countries with democratic institutions.   Conservative critics have long accused the State Department’s Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub of helping to censor the American right. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s new harm reduction initiative is helping prevent needless deaths.

Western,https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/examining-chinese-citizens-views-on-state-surveillance/,3.5048769372277335,"The relentless advance of new and more invasive surveillance technologies poses a growing threat to open societies and human rights. The need to understand their impact around the world has never been more pressing. Freedom House’s Freedom on the net 2023 report underscores this urgency, highlighting an escalation of digital repression in many countries including Iran, Myanmar and the Philippines. The report has identified China as the nation with the most oppressive internet environment for the ninth consecutive year. A new ASPI report, Surveillance, privacy and agency: insights from China, examines how, in addition to online repression and surveillance, the People’s Republic of China has become the world’s primary example of tech-enhanced social control with its society-wide system of ‘techno-authoritarianism’. Over the past year, ASPI and a non-government research partner worked on this project, which is designed to share detailed information on state surveillance in the PRC and engage thousands of PRC residents on the issue of surveillance technology. The decision has been made not to identify this partner to preserve its access to specific research techniques and data and to protect its staff. The Chinese Communist Party is increasing its grip on power through an expanding and near-ubiquitous physical and digital surveillance system facilitated by a strict online censorship apparatus and internet-linked physical surveillance devices. China’s cities are covered by more CCTV surveillance cameras than any other cities in the world. Police agencies use facial recognition to monitor human behaviour; link people’s digital identities with their physical movements through specific devices; and collect DNA, voice prints and iris scans into vast databases. The CCP is working on ways to centralise the data collected and analyse it in more detail. We set out to develop a better understanding of how surveillance technologies impact PRC residents, and how they perceive such surveillance. The report shines a light on how the state communicates on issues related to surveillance and provides insights into how a subsection of PRC residents view state surveillance, data privacy, facial recognition, DNA collection and data-management technologies. By looking at how Chinese citizens’ perceptions of surveillance relate to trust in government, one of the main findings offers a glimpse into a complex range of views that is far from a simple dichotomy. Project participants sit across a spectrum of varying degrees of trust and comfort with surveillance technologies. Analysis suggests that survey respondents fall into seven distinct groups, with several in-between categories ranging from dissenters to endorsers. The project explored the reach and potential of an interactive digital platform as an alternative educational and awareness-raising tool designed to engage in environments where information is harshly restricted and controlled. Presenting an analysis of more than 1,700 PRC government procurement documents, the platform encouraged participants to engage with, critically evaluate and share their views on that information. The research platform engaged more than 55,000 PRC residents. Insights from the platform indicate that most participants value privacy but hold mixed views on surveillance. Some participants expressed a preference for consent and active engagement on the issue of surveillance. More than 65% agreed that DNA samples should be collected from the general population only on a voluntary basis. On the other hand, participants were generally comfortable with the widespread use of certain types of surveillance that are seen to provide a ‘security dividend’, such as cameras. In general, the project found that PRC state narratives about government surveillance and technology implementation appear to be at least partly effective. Our analysis of PRC state media identified four main narratives supporting the use of government surveillance: surveillance helps to fight crime; the PRC’s surveillance systems are some of the best in the world; surveillance is commonplace internationally; and surveillance is a ‘double-edged sword’ and people should be concerned for their personal privacy when surveillance is handled by private companies. It’s apparent that public opinion often aligns with PRC state messaging tying surveillance technologies to personal safety and security. For example, when presented with information about the number of surveillance cameras in their community today, a significant proportion of research platform participants said they would prefer the same number of cameras (39%) or more of them (38%). In addition, PRC state narratives make a clear distinction between private and government surveillance, which suggests state efforts to ‘manage’ privacy concerns within acceptable political parameters. Despite the widespread acceptance of surveillance technologies, most people who interacted with our research platform still preferred the option of consenting to surveillance rather than being passively subjected to it. This type of research and approach can provide key insights and nuance to better support local and international advocacy efforts. It’s important for non-government organisations, governments and human rights advocates combating the misuse of surveillance technologies to assess people’s perceptions of those technologies, especially in the realms of privacy; freedom of expression, movement and assembly; and equal access to public services. Gauging the perceptions of populations living with such technologies can support local and international advocacy efforts to improve online and privacy rights by providing a better understanding of local views on privacy, security and governance. That can help shape effective messaging that raises awareness or resonates with existing concerns.

Western,https://www.wired.com/story/chineses-surveillance-state-is-selling-citizens-data-as-a-side-hustle/,5.0963638622055925,"China has long been a billion-plus-person experiment in total state surveillance, with virtually no legal checks on the government's ability to physically and digitally monitor its citizens. When so much control of citizens' private data amasses within a few government agencies, however, it doesn't stay there. Instead, that bounty of private info has also leaked onto a lively black market—one where insiders sell off their own access to any scammer or stalker willing to pay. At the Cyberwarcon security conference in Arlington, Virginia, on Friday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm SpyCloud plan to present their findings from monitoring a collection of black market services that offer cheap and easy searches of Chinese citizens' data. The vendors in many cases obtain that sensitive information by recruiting insiders from Chinese surveillance agencies and government contractors and then reselling their access, no questions asked, to online buyers. The result is an ecosystem that operates in full public view where, for as little as a few dollars worth of cryptocurrency, anyone can query phone numbers, banking details, hotel and flight records, or even location data on target individuals. A screenshot of one of the Telegram-based data broker services' recruitment posts. The large text in Chinese translates to ""Sincere cooperation, recruiting public security insiders."" “China has created this massive surveillance apparatus,” says Aurora Johnson, one of the two SpyCloud researchers who has tracked how surveillance data leaks to the black market. “And ordinary individuals find themselves working in a system where there's not much economic and social mobility and where they have unfettered access to these databases of information based on their jobs in government or at technology companies. So they're abusing that access, in many cases by stealing data and selling it in criminal marketplaces.” The SpyCloud researchers focused on Chinese-language data vendors that offer their services in accounts on the messaging service Telegram, including ones called Carllnet, DogeSGK, and X-Ray. The services, each of which has tens of thousands of members in its Telegram group, describe themselves as SGKs or “shègōng kù,” which the researchers translate as “social engineering libraries”—a name that suggests the services are perhaps primarily used by scammers. All three services use a point system in which customers can make payments—usually in the cryptocurrency Tether, though in some cases the Chinese payment services WePay and Alipay are accepted—for “points,” or earn them by inviting other customers. Customers can then cash in those credits to carry out searches based on identifiers ranging from names or email addresses to phone numbers to usernames on China's QQ, WeChat, or Weibo social networks. In response to those search queries, the services promise data and records on targets including phone numbers, call records, bank accounts, marriage records, vehicle registrations, hotel bookings, and myriad other personal information. For higher payments that range into the hundreds of dollars, the services also offer premium searches for even more sensitive information like passport images or geolocation records, the SpyCloud researchers say, though they only conducted limited experiments on those premium searches. Some of the services specifically promise detailed access to data from China's “big three” state-owned telecommunications firms: China Telecom, China Unicom, and China Mobile. WIRED reached out to Carllnet, DogeSGK, and X-Ray via Telegram, as well as the big three Chinese telecoms whose data they claim to have access to, but none of them responded to requests for comment. In some cases, the services appear to draw on breached databases—collections of data that have been leaked online by hackers—as well as commercially collected data sources similar to those offered by Western data brokers, such as the location data hoovered up by many free smartphone apps. But they also appear to offer information from insiders at tech and telecom firms, banks, and China's state surveillance agencies, and even openly post ads seeking to recruit staffers of those organizations looking for an extra source of income. “Sincerely looking for public security personnel to establish cooperation,” reads one ad posted to Telegram, as translated by SpyCloud. A translated screenshot of a post from one of the Telegram-based data brokers showing an example of geolocation tracking for a target individual. Another post from the X-Ray Telegram feed invites “internal personnel” from “public security, civil affairs, [and] banks” to cooperate with the service. “We welcome elites from all industries who have internal search conditions to join us!” reads a translation of the post. According to one ad, insiders are paid more than 10,000 yuan—or nearly $1,400—a day, while another recruitment post promises twice that much and says some sources will receive payments as high as 70,000 yuan daily, or nearly $10,000. “There are many comrades who cooperate with us and have been cooperating with us stably for several years,” reads one recruitment post. To further assuage fears, it promises “a complete risk avoidance plan to protect you.” Payment to those sources, one ad suggests, comes in the form of “virtual currency,” and offers training in “mixing” and other withdrawal methods “comparable to those of dark network black market personnel,” according to SpyCloud's translation—suggesting that the insiders are likely paid in cryptocurrency, given that “mixing” services are typically used to defeat blockchain analysis-based cryptocurrency tracing. “You can receive money with peace of mind and withdraw money with confidence,” it reads. As further evidence of government surveillance insiders moonlighting in the data broker market, the SpyCloud researchers point to a leak earlier this year of communications and documents from I-Soon, a cyberespionage contractor to the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of State Security. In one leaked chat conversation, one employee of the company suggests to another that “I am just hear here to sell qb,” and “sell some qb yourself.” The SpyCloud researchers interpret “qb” to mean “qíngbào,” or “intelligence.” Given that the average annual salary in China, even at a state-owned IT company, is only around $30,000, the promise—however credible or dubious—of making nearly a third of that daily in exchange for selling access to surveillance data represents a strong temptation, the SpyCloud researchers argue. “These are not necessarily masterminds,” says Johnson. “They're people with opportunity and motive to make a little money on the side.” That some government insiders are in fact cashing in on their access to surveillance data is to be expected amid China's perpetual struggle against corruption, says Dakota Cary, a China-focused policy and cybersecurity researcher at cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, who reviewed SpyCloud's findings. Transparency International, for instance, ranks China 76th in the world out of 180 countries in its Corruption Index, well below every EU country other than Hungary—with which it tied—including Bulgaria and Romania. Corruption is “prevalent in the security services, in the military, in all parts of the government,” says Cary. “It's a top-down cultural attitude in the current political climate. It’s not at all surprising that individuals with this kind of data are effectively renting out the access they have as part of their job.” In their research, SpyCloud's analysts went so far as to attempt to use the Telegram-based data brokers to search for personal information on certain high-ranking officials of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, individual Chinese state-sponsored hackers who have been identified in US indictments, and the CEO of cybersecurity company I-Soon, Wu Haibo. The results of those queries included a grab bag of phone numbers, email addresses, bank card numbers, car registration records, and “hashed” passwords—passwords likely obtained through a data breach that are protected with a form of encryption but sometimes vulnerable to cracking—for those government officials and contractors. In some cases, the data brokers do at least claim to restrict searches to exclude celebrities or government officials. But the researchers say they were usually able to find a workaround. “You can always find another service that's willing to do the search and get some documents on them,” says SpyCloud researcher Kyla Cardona. The result, as Cardona describes it, is an even more unexpected consequence of a system that collects such vast and centralized data on every citizen in the country: Not only does that surveillance data leak into private hands, it also leaks into the hands of those who are watching the watchers. ""It's a double-edged sword,” says Cardona. “This data is collected for them and by them. But it can also be used against them.” In your inbox: Will Knight's AI Lab explores advances in AI The Trump tariffs are how everything works now Big Story: If Anthropic succeeds, a nation of benevolent AI geniuses could be born Scientists claim to have brought back the dire wolf Special Edition: The most dangerous hackers you’ve never heard of More From WIRED Reviews and Guides © 2025 Condé Nast.

         This week on ""Intelligence Matters,"" host Michael Morell speaks with Wall Street Journal reporters Liza Lin and Josh Chin about their new book ""Surveillance State: Inside China's Quest to Launch a New Era of Social Control."" Their new reporting examines how China's data collection goes beyond that of other countries as China seeks to create a model to export as an alternative to democratic governance. Lin and Chin detail Silicon Valley's involvement in the buildup of China's surveillance state and how the technology is used to surveil Uyghurs in Xinjiang.  HIGHLIGHTS:  Download, rate and subscribe here: iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher. INTELLIGENCE MATTERS WITH LIZA LIN AND JOSH CHIN PRODUCER: PAULINA SMOLINSKI MICHAEL MORELL: Liza, Josh, it is great to have you on intelligence matters. Welcome. JOSH CHIN: Thank you. It's a real pleasure to be here. LIZA LIN: Thank you for having us. MICHAEL MORELL:You guys are the authors of a terrific book. It's called Surveillance State: Inside China's Quest to Launch a New Era of Social Control. Congratulations on the book. I read it from cover to cover. I found it interesting. I found it insightful. I found it readable and more than a bit scary. I'd like to start by asking you guys how you define a surveillance state. How do you think about it in terms of a definition? JOSH CHIN: I think the way we thought about a surveillance state is a state in which governance, the act of managing society is driven by and really indivisible from advanced surveillance technologies. You see this really clearly in China, where the Communist Party there has melded its traditional approach to governing and controlling China with cutting edge technologies like facial recognition, techniques like data mining, in order to create a kind of more nimble form of authoritarianism. MICHAEL MORELL: It's interesting that you talk about advanced surveillance technologies, because one of the questions I wanted to ask is, how does surveillance in China today compare to old Mao style surveillance where neighbor was spying on neighbor? How do you about think about that? JOSH CHIN: It's interesting, when we started looking into this, as you know, one of the things we discovered was that really I mean, just to a certain degree, all states are surveillance states going back to the beginning of states. In the sense that anyone who's trying to govern a large number of people needs to have information about those people in order to govern them. James C. Scott sort of famously described this as rendering societies legible. And so this has been all the way back to the Romans conducting surveys so they knew who to tax and who to draft for the Roman Legion. It's as old as time, basically.  I think in the 20th century, what you started to see with Mao and with other totalitarian leaders was this utopian idea. This idea that you could collect enough information to mold society in a scientifically ideal way. I think the difference between Mao and what Mao was aiming for and the types of information he was collecting and what you see now is mostly a difference in volume and value of data collected. Mao obviously was limited to human data collection. So he had a lot of human spies. He had this vast domestic spying network, hundreds of thousands of people, and of course, was encouraging other people, regular people to inform on each other. And the Communist Party now, I mean, they still do some of that, but they have these other just vastly more powerful tools that are so much more efficient at collecting and analyzing information. And so they just have the ability to consider this utopian project of engineering society in a way that Mao never actually really could. LIZA LIN: I just to add on to that, the intent for China to surveil its citizens was always there. But what we really saw in the last kind of 10 to 15 years was the ability because there's been huge advances in technology. For example, the advent of deep learning and the realization that you had these fast processing chips that could crunch that data in a very efficient manner. So crunched down large amounts of data and draw analysis from that data as per what Josh mentioned. That really actually spurred the development of China's modern day surveillance state. MICHAEL MORELL: What are the key components of the surveillance system in China? How do you think about that?  LIZA LIN: To me the way China's surveillance state stands out is in two areas. One is the breadth, the data collection. And when we talk about the breadth of the data collection, I refer you to the amount of touch points where the Chinese government can actually extract data from its citizens. So the Chinese government has access to probably about 400 million cameras across the country.  And I think the difference between China and many other countries is that all these cameras are largely state owned. Unlike in the U.S., where you have a ton of Amazon ring cameras that are privately owned, a lot of the surveillance cameras that you see on the street in China are owned by government agencies and largely by the Chinese police. And beyond access to those 400 million cameras, the Chinese government still has access to about a billion smartphones that the Chinese citizens use. And that's because there are a series of national security and intelligence laws that were put in place in China over the last decade that actually allow the Chinese government to have access to a lot of the information that Chinese tech companies collect. And the difference in China versus other countries is that a lot of citizens are largely reliant on Chinese apps. And in particular, this one app called WeChat, which is made by and run by a company called Tencent. And on this app WeChat, it kind of functions quite similarly to a mesh of Facebook, Instagram, Google and Amazon. And on top of that, they are mobile payments. So the Chinese government, through this app, has the ability to figure out what its citizens are searching online, what they're saying online, what they're buying online and where they're traveling.  So there are a lot of these touch points in which the Chinese government could actually extract data from its citizens to just understand what's going on on the ground and add to that mobile phone trackers. And right now, over the last two years of COVID, we've definitely seen the Chinese government improve in its ability to collect data on where your smartphone has been. So, for example, a lot of the COVID health codes that China has been using over the last 2 to 3 years, which have been tracking your position and where you've been going in the last two weeks just to ascertain if you're a health risk. That's an additional layer of data that the Chinese government now has the ability to collect on all its citizens in real time.  So I would say that China really stands out for the breadth of the data collection and its ambition. So it's ambition really is the second reason why we see China as such a standout. Undoubtedly, China is probably the only country out there that hopes to use surveillance to create this techno-utopian state. And as we mentioned in our research and in the book, China has this ambition to use the data collected to analyze any future threats to its governance and to identify these threats quickly and do something about it, to create an alternative model to what democracy could offer. Because as a country itself, an authoritarian country does not have the same democratic institutions that developed Western countries do. MICHAEL MORELL: Liza, that's a tremendous amount of data you just talked about. And then earlier, you talked about the use of A.I. machine learning to do something with that data that would allow the Chinese government to take actions that they think are necessary to protect the state. Can you talk a little bit more, guys, about how they actually use AI? How they use machine learning? I think that would be insightful. JOSH CHIN: I think probably the most vivid example in China and it's one that the listeners of this podcast probably have heard of is Xinjiang, which is a remote region, far northwestern China on the doorstep of Central Asia. And Xinjiang stands out because it's home to a large population of Turkic Muslims, including the Uyghurs, who have always chafed at Communist Party and at Han Chinese Rule. And so there's always been a bit of conflict out there. And in recent years, the Communist Party, their solution to that has been to rule out what I think is probably the closest thing we've ever gotten to a sort of truly dystopian, sort of Orwellian surveillance state.And what they've done is they've gone out and, blanketed the entire region. It's twice the size of Texas. It's a massive place. But they blanketed the entire region in cameras and microphones, other sorts of sensors, security gates, to the point where if you're a Uyghur moving around in Xinjiang outside or even inside your home, basically everything you're doing is capable of being of being recorded and analyzed in real time.  And so all these sensors feed this data into a centralized data platform. It was actually built by a defense contractor. And it's modeled on systems that the U.S. military uses to coordinate things, sort of complicated joint operations like counterinsurgency operations. And so all this data gets sucked into the centralized platform and then they use it there. So these cameras have, the sensors themselves have artificial intelligence built into them. So the cameras can recognize people's faces. They can recognize people's voices, that sort of thing. And then all the data gets analyzed on this platform in ways that it's a bit of a black box. We don't know exactly how they calculate it, but they use this data to categorize people according to the level of threat that they, the Communist Party perceives in that.  In one system that we looked at, there were three categories: unsafe, safe and average. And and so for people who were deemed unsafe and that means that they may have filled up their car with gasoline one too many times, or they may have a digital Koran on their phone, or they may be friends with the wrong people or whatever sort of biographical markers the Communist Party is using. The people who have those markers, who are seen as unsafe for a long time were being shipped off to a gulag of re-education centers. MICHAEL MORELL: So it's your discussion of Xinjiang in the book that really makes this whole thing chilling. But there's a flip side of the coin, right? You tell another story about how these tools can actually be used for good. And then I'm wondering if you can talk about that a little bit. LIZA LIN: Josh did a ton of the reporting in Xinjiang. On my part, I traveled to a lot of these wealthy Han Chinese cities that were located on the east coast of China and in those wealthy cities, what you saw were the same systems often built by the same manufacturers as well, that were used for repression in Xinjiang, were used to make city governance a lot more efficient. So, for example, the facial recognition that would possibly identify a security threat in Xinjiang would be used by the Chinese police to identify buckets of society that they deemed as people that could cause national instability or some harm. So people that the Chinese police would use facial recognition in the wealthier Chinese cities to identify would be ex-convicts, for example, or ex-convicts that were just released. And they wanted to monitor just to make sure that they were settling back into society much better. And then other people that they would use these facial recognition systems and CCTV cameras to identify would be fugitives on the run or people that they knew were notorious drug pushers.  So all these are the kind of people that you really, as a normal regular person, you wouldn't be wanting to walk alongside on the street with. And it wasn't just identifying people of interest as well. These same sensors that were sucking up video and car counts or a number of people counts were used to identify traffic accidents really quickly to get first responders to the scene. For example,we pull out a city in east China called Hangzhou and Hangzhou might not ring a bell to most of your listeners, but the companies that are headquartered in Hangzhou are probably would. So a company like Alibaba, for example, is headquartered in Hangzhou and a company like Hikvision, which is the world's largest maker of CCTV cameras. They're also headquartered in Hangzhou. So for these reasons, the Hangzhou government just has tended to really try and lean towards making Hangzhou a smart city in a digital sense. They've been very embracing of using technology to run the city, and using these companies as partners.  Hangzhou used to be the fifth most congested city in China, probably about two or three years ago. What the city government did was to put in place a system of CCTV cameras and sensors that were absorbing how many cars were on the street and using that to optimize traffic lights. So in periods of peak traffic, the traffic lights would stay green for cars a lot longer. And that kind of helped Hangzhou drop from fifth most congested to 57th most congested city in a matter of a couple of years. For a reporter that had been traveling in the region so frequently, I often went to Hangzhou for work. And if you were stuck in a Hangzhou jam, you would be stuck for 40 minutes and you'd be moving maybe a mile just because the Hangzhou Road Network was not established and the subway system was very immature and yet population and car population in particular probably doubled or tripled.  It was small things like these that the city government had been using these surveillance systems to help just make life more frictionless. I think the one example that really stood out to us in our research and reporting was when we found a guy whose mother had fallen into a river and they lived on the outskirts of Hangzhou City. But in that area, the Hangzhou government was still starting to put these systems in place. His mom had fallen into the river and he was really lucky. And they were very lucky because a neighbor was around the corner and fished her out. But she still was in a condition where she needed medical help. So the nearest hospital had sent an ambulance over to get her. And once she was in the ambulance, the driver had turned on this system that allowed traffic lights and sensors to recognize its license plate. So, you know, the same sort of computer vision that's used in facial recognition in Xinjiang was used here to recognize the license plate of the ambulance and to turn all the traffic lights green from the point of picking her up to the hospital.  So that shaved off half the time that it needed for her to get to hospital and to get treatment and to drain out her lungs. So in such a life and death situation, it really makes you wonder if such surveillance systems actually might have a use. And in the case of Hangzhou, there were a lot of people that we spoke to which just felt like the positive externalities of having such a system outweighed any of the data collection, the more sinister data collection kind of outcomes. MICHAEL MORELL: Given that, in Han China, is there a resistance in general to the surveillance state or is there an acceptance of it? JOSH CHIN: This is actually one of the most fascinating aspects of doing all of this work. AndI think it's our understanding that changed the most in looking at this. And I think we started off like a lot of people, with the assumption that in China privacy actually doesn't matter that much. And in fact, if you look at the official Chinese government approved dictionary, the word for privacy doesn't appear there until the late nineties. So it is a relatively new concept. And I should say,  I think at least up until recently, a large number of people in China, the vast majority of them probably just didn't really have the luxury to be thinking about things like privacy. They're more concerned with putting food on the table. But in larger cities, as we did more and more work and talk to more people, we realized that in bigger cities with more educated populations you do have the beginnings of a privacy movement, an understanding of privacy.  And you had quite a few controversies actually involving big Chinese tech companies. One of them was Baidu, which is the Chinese equivalent of Google. In one instance, the CEO had been at a forum and said, we Chinese tech companies have a huge advantage because our customers don't care about what we do with our data, so we can do anything we want with it. And that spurred a huge backlash. And what was interesting is the way that the Chinese government handled this was- it's a country with this really extremely successful and powerful censorship apparatus. You would expect them to just use that to quash any talk of privacy. But actually what they what they did was a little bit of jujitsu where they actually threw their support behind a lot of these controversies and they had state media going after Chinese companies for mishandling customer data and essentially put themselves on the side of the people and kind of defined privacy concerns exclusively in terms of what private companies did.  So the government use of data has never really, at least again, not until recently, been scrutinized much in China. And now we've gotten to a really interesting period, which is, anyone who's been paying attention to the headlines in China knows we recently had nationwide protests against the zero COVID regime that the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, had been promoting. It's hard to overstate how surprising these protests were. This was the biggest demonstration of public defiance against the Communist Party since 1989, since the pro-democracy protests back then. And at the center of it was this frustration with the controls that the Communist Party was imposing using its surveillance technologies. So I think we're at a new moment. It's be interesting to see how it plays out, because I think that this is one instance in which the Communist Party may have overplayed its hand. MICHAEL MORELL: One of the things that I learned from the book was that China did not put this advanced surveillance system in place all by itself. It had some help. And can you talk about that? LIZA LIN: Sure. So what we found in our research is that Silicon Valley has been there supporting the development of China's surveillance state right from its incubation. China's digital surveillance state, it's in its current form, really only started to take root at the turn of the century. So around the year 2000, 2001, you saw the Chinese police a lot more willing to turn to digital technology to gather data. And when it did so, it ran these huge fairs, large expos in which it invited foreign companies to come down and to basically showcase their wares. Just to allow Chinese police to have a look at what's out there and decide what they wanted to buy. And the companies that turned out at these exhibitions were all either pioneers of Silicon Valley or the who's who of the digital world at that point. So you saw people like Sun Microsystems come down. You saw Cisco attend the exhibition and showcase what they had to offer. You saw the now defunct Canadian company Nortel Networks come down. And there was also Siemens from Germany. And all these big companies were right there at the very first Chinese exhibitions trying to sell things such as fingerprint database collection systems or other censorship systems like filters for the great Internet Firewall. So we definitely saw Silicon Valley play a very important role in the incubation of the early Chinese digital surveillance state. Fast forward two decades to the present day. What you're seeing is Silicon Valley companies, not not just providing systems, they're actually providing components to the surveillance state.  So if you think about the hot dish drive industry globally, it's really an oligopoly. The market share is mostly taken up by American companies such as Western Digital and Seagate. And these two companies have been known to be selling these hard disk drives to Chinese surveillance companies in large numbers and even optimizing some of the hard disk drives as surveillance hard drives for the Chinese. And it isn't just like hard disk drives. You need the processing power as well. So chip companies like Nvidia and Intel, they've been known to sell their GPUs and CPUs these really high end chips to Chinese surveillance companies in order to power the data analysis that goes on on the back end.  If you think about Silicon Valley involvement, it's huge. And not just in components. If you think about the financial aspect of things, a lot of U.S. private equity companies and venture capital companies were the first companies to give Chinese surveillance startups a leg up in the game by funding them. So there are a lot of ways that the West and in particular the U.S. has contributed to the development of China's surveillance apparatus. MICHAEL MORELL: I want to switch gears a little bit, guys, and talk about China's export of its surveillance system to other countries. The conventional wisdom, as you know, says that China wants to shape the world in its image, in its authoritarian image as a surveillance state. And you push back on that notion. Can you talk about that? JOSH CHIN: This view of China as wanting to push its system on the rest of the world, it makes sense. The people who have that view, it's not coming out of nowhere. One of the pieces of evidence that people often cite is Xi Jinping himself, China's leader. He's talked about how China wants to make contributions to the human pursuit of better governance systems and that sort of thing. And it's clearly diplomatically, it's spending a lot of capital, a lot of time trying to cultivate relationships around the globe. In some cases trying to co-opt global institutions like the WTO and W.H.O. But what we saw when we started looking deep into this is just in terms through the lens of exports, of surveillance. And this model that they have in particular of this sort of digital authoritarianism is that it's more complicated.  They are definitely selling these technologies and these systems and the ideas behind them around the globe. We don't have really great data on this now. But the most recent number we have is from a scholar at the University of Texas named Sheena Greitens who dug around and found that there were at least 80 countries globally in the year 2020 who had imported state surveillance systems from China. And those were those range from authoritarian countries all the way to Western democracies, local police stations in France and Germany and that sort of thing.  One example that we saw in detail was in Uganda. Which is one of these countries that kind of hovers between the United States and China and maintains relationships with both. It's nominally a democracy, but the leader there during the seventies won every election going back decades. And there are, of course, allegations of election fraud and whatnot. And China has been cultivating its relationship with Museveni for many years. And a few years ago, they sold him a sort of state surveillance starter kit. They flew Ugandan police out to China to go to Beijing, where they were given lessons in how these systems are used. And just like China, Museveni sort of initially said, oh, these systems are for fighting crime, but then quickly used them in political ways to track opposition political figures.  In some ways, what you saw in Uganda is China is exporting its system. But the way that it was used in Uganda is not the way it's used in China. And that's partly because it can't be. China has all these advantages that a lot of other countries don't. China has a lot of money. It has an immense, pretty well-trained, fairly tech savvy bureaucracy. A lot of countries really can't replicate China's model. And China, I think, realizes that. But what they're interested in is promoting this idea of governments being able to use these technologies in whatever way they see fit. So the idea is not that they want to copy themselves around the world, but they just want to disrupt the existing Western dominated order which suggests that state power should be restrained and individual rights protected against invasions of this kind. They want to upset that conversation and make it okay for governments to use these technologies to control societies. MICHAEL MORELL: I want to ask you guys about the West's response to the rise of China's surveillance state. What have we been doing? Have we been effective and are there better approaches to what we're doing? LIZA LIN: That's a great question, because in the last couple of months, you've definitely seen governments such as the U.S. take action to stop the flow of the components that I talked about earlier and to the Chinese surveillance state. So on October 7th, you saw the White House put out new export sanctions. And with these sanctions, with these regulations, they barred U.S. companies from assisting in the development of China's advanced chip and semiconductor industry. And that meant if you're a U.S. person or a U.S. company, you couldn't be selling components or you couldn't even be working or helping in any form. U.S. persons were not allowed to help with the development.  One of the reasons cited was military. So they didn't want to empower the Chinese military by helping with the development of high end chips. But they also wanted to stop the expansion of the Chinese surveillance state. And that was one of the reasons cited for these controls. So I definitely have seen some steps being taken in recent months. And on how these steps actually play out in China, it's still a big question mark at this point. Because as with many export controls, you do see workarounds and in small quantities, Chinese companies still can get these high end chips in very small quantities. So when you think about what governments are doing to stop the flow of either money or technology into the Chinese surveillance state, one company that often keeps coming up is a company called SenseTime. SenceTimes is China's largest AI unicorn. And I would say it was probably one of the start ups that reading made this idea of facial recognition, using facial recognition in solving crimes really such a such a wide and global idea. So with Sensetime, what we saw was the U.S. government put one of Sensetime entities both on the entity list and on the investment blacklists. So if you were Sensetime's Beijing entity, you couldn't get chips from U.S. companies, you were on the entity list. And if you were Sensetime's Hong Kong entity, then you couldn't get any financing from U.S. investors.  And Sensetime is this company that had been really funded by people like Fidelity. Qualcomm had a stake in it. So what the U.S. government had essentially tried to do was to restrict the flow of money or chips to Sensetime. But in reality, because of all these loopholes that I mentioned earlier, it didn't succeed. So with Sensetime, what we found out was when the company listed last year, 2020 in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, it actually had a statement coming out saying that even though it was technically on the entity list, it was only one subsidiary of Sensetime that was on the entity list. It was its Beijing subsidiary. So its Shanghai subsidiary was free to buy whatever Intel and Nvidia chips that they needed to power the surveillance systems. So the loophole that I talked about earlier, one of these legal loopholes, just putting one subsidiary on the entity list wasn't enough. And SenseTime was also put on a Treasury blacklist at the end of 2021, which really barred U.S. investors from investing in it. But what you saw when it eventually went to IPO was there was still U.S. money in it. And that was because, and this is according to a company, that was because its Hong Kong entity was on that Treasury blacklist. But it was a Cayman Islands entity that was listed in Hong Kong. So there are all these ways that the U.S. has been trying to stop the flow or stop its companies and investors from aiding the development of surveillance in China. But really, there are some limitations. JOSH CHIN: The other plane on which this conversation exists. It's kind of just on the level of policy and ideology actually. The real challenge for the U.S. completely apart from the technological question is the appeal of this model, of the Chinese model. Which I think is around the globe, it's very simple. The Chinese government has this very simple message which is that these technologies can be used to increase security and improve certain aspects of lives in ways that we've never seen before. And they should just be, everyone should be able to use them however they want. And the U.S. doesn't really have a good response to that.There is no coherent Western vision or democratic vision of how these technologies should be deployed.  And I think that's, in part, in the U.S., it's an issue. The U.S. has always been schizophrenic about the role of technology and data in society. Especially, since the rise of Silicon Valley, because Silicon Valley companies push this idea that it's the free flow of information that gave rise to innovation in Silicon Valley. And so you can't cut it off even though there are potentially bad side effects from having huge amounts of personal data floating around and being exploited by companies and governments. That's just a price you have to pay for innovation. That's the U.S. view of things. And the conversation hasn't really moved significantly beyond that. It has started to move beyond that in other places. In Europe, for example, in the U.K., where you do have rules that are being implemented to really restrain some of the more invasive technologies like facial recognition. Right now, though, where you have regulators whose job it is to keep an eye on these things. But those are early days. And I think a lot of people feel that until the U.S. gets on board with it, you're really not going to have a compelling democratic alternative to the Chinese vision. MICHAEL MORELL: But we need one. We absolutely need one. The book is Surveillance State: Inside China's Quest to Launch a New Era of Social Control. The authors are Josh Chin and Liza Lin. Josh, Liza thank you very much for joining us. JOSH CHIN: It was a tremendous pleasure. Thank you, Michael.

Western,https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-road-to-digital-unfreedom-president-xis-surveillance-state/,1.6263514026504864,"Select your citation format: Since President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, China has significantly increased controls over its already censored cyberspace—with a ruling that will allow jail terms for spreading “rumors” online, a cybersecurity law that will facilitate state control and data access, crackdowns on unauthorized VPN connections, and emphasis on the concept of “internet sovereignty.” At the same time, technological innovations in such areas as big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things are increasingly being harnessed to monitor the lives and activities of China’s 1.4 billion people. The new arsenal of the Chinese surveillance state includes mass video-surveillance projects incorporating facial-recognition technology; voice-recognition software that can identify speakers on phone calls; and a sweeping and intrusive program of DNA collection. In addition, officials are at work on a nationwide Social Credit System (SCS) intended to assess the conduct of every Chinese citizen. Since the internet’s arrival in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in 1994, digital technologies have provided a critical channel of communication for Chinese citizens. In an environment where speech and access to information are heavily restricted, the internet has enabled citizens to get uncensored news, speak their minds, and even organize protests. Over the last two decades, the use of internet and digital technologies in the PRC has been growing rapidly. According to a mid-2018 estimate by the official China Internet Network Information Center (the body in charge of the .cn country code), there were 29.7 million first-time internet users in China in the first part of that year. Altogether, the agency reported, those using the internet in China numbered approximately eight-hundred million.1 Xiao Qiang is research scientist and director of the Counter-Power Lab at the University of California–Berkeley’s School of Information. He is also founder and editor-in-chief of the China Digital Times. Between 1991 and 2002, he served as executive director of Human Rights in China, an NGO based in New York. View all work by Xiao Qiang Yet as the technologies that once promised to enable a free flow of information have spread, authorities have intensified their efforts to bend these systems to their own purposes. The Chinese government has set up a series of mechanisms aimed at asserting its dominance in cyberspace. It has also increasingly combined an extensive physical infrastructure of surveillance and coercion with cutting-edge digital technologies. Censorship and propaganda have gone hand in hand: Those who express unorthodox views online may become the subjects of targeted personal attacks in the state media. Surveillance and intimidation are further supplemented by outright coercion, including police visits and arrests. China’s current leader Xi Jinping, who ascended to the posts of PRC president and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary in 2012, has prioritized control over the information sphere in a bid to [End Page 53] forestall challenges to the CCP’s legitimacy. Xi has placed considerable emphasis on the concept of “internet sovereignty,” asserting the primacy of rules made by national governments and the authority of national-level regulators over web content and providers. Rather than limiting themselves to playing defense against opposition activity, PRC officials have employed digital technologies to monitor and control society, especially in the era of “big data,” artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). By leveraging information and resource asymmetries, state agencies and the companies that cooperate with them can turn these innovative technologies into tools for manipulating ordinary citizens. Big data, for instance, is an invaluable resource for making predictions. Officials can draw on this capacity to anticipate protests and even major surges in online public opinion, enabling them to act preemptively to quash opposition. In another authoritarian application of big data, PRC authorities are working to integrate information from a wide array of sources into a nationwide Social Credit System (SCS) that would assess the conduct of every person in the country, an innovation worthy of George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four. As Wired magazine has put it, China’s new generation of surveillance operations is indeed where “big data meets Big Brother.”2 Under Xi Jinping, Chinese authorities have been cracking down on subversive speech on the internet while reinforcing the digital bulwark of PRC information control—the so-called Great Firewall of China—with new technology. Shortly after Xi’s November 2012 accession to the post of general secretary, Chinese authorities began honing their tools for monitoring and penalizing subversive commentary on the internet. In December of that year, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed regulations mandating that those wishing to use the internet via mobile phones or register social-media accounts supply their real names to internet providers. The regulations also required companies to take on a greater role in removing and reporting offending posts.3 In September 2013, a groundbreaking ruling by the Supreme People’s Court and Supreme People’s Procuratorate authorized prison terms of up to three years for the posting of comments that spread rumors and are deemed to be defamatory if these posts have been reposted more than five-hundred times or viewed by five-thousand people. Jail sentences may also be imposed over posts that organize protests or incite ethnic unrest.4 Soon after that, state media revealed that the government had hired more than two-million individuals as “microblog monitors” to report on online postings to official censors (these “monitors” do not themselves have the power to delete posts).5 [End Page 54] The PRC government has also been developing new instruments for policing cyberspace more broadly. Early in 2014, the CCP formed a Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs chaired by President Xi. In November 2016, the country adopted its first cybersecurity law. On 2 May 2017, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued the first comprehensive update in twelve years to regulations requiring government licenses for all websites that distribute news—including not only traditional websites, but also messaging and other apps, blogs and microblogs, and internet forums. The 2016 cybersecurity law places a series of demands on internet companies, with the cumulative effect of facilitating state control and data access. For instance, companies must conduct increased surveillance of their networks and supply information to state investigators on request, in addition to having their equipment reviewed for security. They are also required to censor prohibited content and to reduce user anonymity by requiring real-name registration. Service providers classed as “critical information infrastructure operators” must keep certain information (including personal data) in data centers within China’s borders, and companies must undergo a security assessment if they are to transfer their data out of the country.6 On top of these legal and institutional innovations, Chinese authorities have stepped up their administrative efforts to keep internet providers in line. Instances of what the CAC calls “Yuetan” (“Called in for Meetings with the Authorities”) have become more frequent after major internet companies Sina and NetEase were found to be in “serious violation of regulations” and were subsequently called in for meetings.7 On 1 June 2015, the CAC released a new set of regulations that call on the agency’s central and local branches to hold meetings with the responsible persons at internet news and information-service organizations following major violations. Meetings involve pointing out concerns, issuing warnings, and giving instructions for rectifying behavior. If changes are not satisfactory, the targeted company can be given further warnings, or it may face a fine or even a revocation or suspension of its business license. Before mid-2017, authorities’ targets were largely online news portals; the focus has since shifted, and entertainment and video platforms, together with live broadcasts, now make up the primary subjects of Yuetan. The number of Yuetan conducted nationwide grew from 820 in 2015 and 678 in 2016 to 2,003 in 2017. In the first half of 2018, 760 of these meetings were held. Finally, Chinese authorities continue to refine their technical countermeasures against online activity deemed a threat to their control. To limit cross-border internet connections and keep PRC residents from accessing what are viewed as dangerous sites, officials have made regular updates to the Great Firewall. This system renders tens of thousands of websites off limits to users in the PRC, in addition to serving as a tool of [End Page 55] surveillance. A research project from the Counter-Power Lab at the University of California–Berkeley School of Information has identified the domain names of 1,382 blocked sites, which include YouTube, Google, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, and WordPress.8 Early in 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a sweeping effort to shut down unauthorized internet connections. This has particularly affected virtual private network (VPN) services—encrypted connections through a remote server used by some in the PRC to circumvent the Great Firewall.9 China has made a systematic effort to disrupt VPN services since at least September 2012, when it began deploying technology that is “able to ‘learn, discover and block’ the encrypted communications methods used by a number of different VPN systems.” Telecom giants such as China Unicom can cut connections when they identify a VPN in use. Some limited internal use of VPNs by companies is permitted, but a usage record is required. Moreover, only specially licensed vendors may supply the necessary systems.10 Enforcement of the restrictions on VPN usage has been tightened since the new cybersecurity law was passed in 2016. In addition to bringing about the shuttering of Chinese VPN services, this campaign appears to have proven compelling to Apple: In July 2017, the global tech giant confirmed that it would cease offering prohibited VPN apps through the version of its app store aimed at PRC users.11 China’s intensified internet-control mechanisms are now entering the “big data” era, and they have increasingly come to intersect with the PRC’s wider surveillance and information-collection infrastructure. In the past five years, both Chinese state agencies and their private-sector partners have begun exploiting their access to a wide array of systematic data about citizens. China has been the world’s fastest-growing user of surveillance cameras, a trend mainly driven by government usage. Over the past decade, technological advances have made these cameras ever more effective instruments for monitoring China’s 1.4 billion people. Today, facial recognition and intelligent analysis—technology that flags objects or events of interest when these are picked up by the camera—are becoming standard features of video surveillance. The recognition of faces by cameras began to become a reality in 2010, when researchers made a breakthrough in the deep-learning algorithm used for speech and image recognition. The algorithm can also assess in real time the number and density of people in the frame, individuals’ gender, and the characteristics of clothing and vehicles. Compared to other countries, China—with both a vast population and an extensive video-surveillance system—has a huge amount of face data ready for use in the machine-learning process [End Page 56] that is used to refine facial-recognition systems. Furthermore, the government’s strong interest in this area helps to ensure that the industry stays supplied with ample resources for upgrades to equipment and research algorithms. In 2015, the PRC’s National Development and Reform Commission set in motion a project by the name of “Sharp Eyes,” an ambitious plan for video surveillance that builds on the “Skynet” video-surveillance program initiated in 2005. The plan calls for government bodies from local CCP committees on up to participate in creating an “omnipresent, fully networked, always working and fully controllable” system, incorporating facial-recognition technology. The goal is for this system to provide “100 percent” coverage in specified types of areas—including public spaces in residential communities—by 2020. With assistance from an associated database, officials will be able to cross-check data from cameras all over China.12 In 2017, it was reported on CCTV that the “Skynet” project had been completed, bringing into being the largest video-surveillance network in the world. By that year, China’s network included 176 million surveillance cameras, and there were plans to increase this number to a staggering 626 million by the decade’s close. The network’s many AI-equipped cameras monitor the gender, clothing, and height of passersby, transforming the information captured on screen into data.13 Voice-recognition software is also increasingly used around China to identify speakers in phone calls. In May 2012, the regional government of Anhui—which has been a “pilot province” in this area—and the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) launched a public-private partnership with the Anhui-based company iFlytek, China’s leading supplier of speech-recognition systems. The objective was to create the “Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Public Security for Intelligent Voice Technology.” As of 2015, seventy-thousand voice samples had been collected in Anhui alone. In 2017, the MPS launched pilot programs with iFlytek aimed at automatically detecting particular voices when these are picked up over the phone.14 Chinese state media assert that voice-recognition software will be used to assist with counterterrorism efforts and “stability maintenance,” and that these capabilities have already proved an asset in cases of drug trafficking, kidnapping, fraud, and blackmail.15 In recent years, the PRC’s ever-tighter surveillance network has been strengthened by a new form of data collection: National officials, employing controversial methods, have been rapidly building up the country’s DNA database. Work on this database, which is supervised by the [End Page 57] MPS, reportedly began in the early years of the new millennium, under the tenth five-year plan for science and technology. The Chinese government now boasts a vast DNA database synchronized with hundreds of local databases, and official documents suggest that it aims to nearly double the number of records included from the present 54 million to 100 million by 2020.16 Combined with other forms of big data and powerful technologies such as facial recognition and AI, this database has the potential to become a formidable instrument of surveillance and repression. The PRC’s massive program of DNA-data collection seriously infringes on the privacy of Chinese citizens. It also is unfair in its treatment of vulnerable groups, including ethnic minorities. Since privacy protections and other regulations are lacking, the compulsory gathering of DNA samples extends well beyond individuals with criminal convictions. Citizens under no suspicion of criminal activity may be required to offer their DNA, particularly if they belong to groups regarded as “high-risk” or singled out for heightened surveillance. These categories include not only dissidents and members of the largely Muslim Uyghur ethnic minority, but also migrant workers and even coal miners and property tenants in a particular city. Even if these individuals have committed no crimes, they are officially viewed as possible dangers to social stability.17 China’s western Xinjiang region, home to the Uyghurs, has effectively become “a ‘frontline laboratory’ for data-driven surveillance.” Cameras are ubiquitous in Xinjiang, and their view extends well outside urban centers. The methods employed in this province may well fore-shadow the nationwide implementation of similar “predictive-policing tactics” in the months to come.18 Xinjiang is also the place in which DNA-collection efforts have taken their most extreme form. As of September 2016, those applying for passports in Xinjiang had to provide a blood sample for DNA testing, along with other forms of biometric data (fingerprints, a voice recording, and a 3-D image of themselves).19 More recently, authorities have begun using obligatory health checks to obtain residents’ DNA and other identifying information. According to guidelines issued in 2017, the PRC government has now mandated that DNA samples be collected from all Xinjiang residents between the ages of 12 and 65, as well as from individuals seen as particular dangers to stability (known as “focus personnel”) and their [End Page 58] family members, even if outside this age range. The guidelines detail the proper methods to be used and the authorities responsible for biometric-data collection, which is carried out either in the home or at the closest of a number of central stations. Once collected, biometric data is bundled with an individual’s hukou, a form of household registration. Notably, the requirement to submit to biometric-information collection extends to individuals registered in Xinjiang but who reside elsewhere in mainland China.20 As anthropologist Darren Byler told the Diplomat, the data obtained will be “correlated to ethnicity, employment, gender, age, foreign travel history, household registration, individual and family criminal history, and religious practice.”21 In 2014, China’s State Council announced an ambitious plan made possible by new digital technology: a nationwide Social Credit System that “covers the entire society.” This project would involve tracking the activities and offering assessments of people as well as enterprises. By the target date of 2020, the Council anticipated an entry on each PRC citizen. This information was to be drawn from private as well as from public sources, although the entries that had been added to the relevant platform as of mid-2017 came chiefly from government sources: More than thirty bureaucratic bodies had collectively supplied four-hundred datasets. Officials are to be able to search this system by biometric indicators, including fingerprints. Meanwhile, China’s government in 2015 authorized a number of private actors—including Alibaba, China’s Amazon—to begin work on social-credit platforms of their own.22 While nationwide databases assessing the financial credibility of individuals exist in many countries, social-credit systems assign citizens a comprehensive score that takes into account not only finances, but also personal behavior. For instance, the system operated by Alibaba collects data on individuals’ personal circles of friends, their shopping habits, and even the remarks they make on social media. Social-credit scores can determine the results of applications for personal loans, jobs, visas, and more.23 A Chinese government document outlining plans for the SCS over the period 2014–20 calls for promoting “the widespread use of unified social-credit codes in economic and social activities.”24 In a state distinguished by its pervasive efforts at monitoring and surveillance, the quantity of data that may eventually be incorporated into the SCS is vast. We have already mentioned the government’s growing activities in the areas of video surveillance and DNA collection. Chinese citizens are also regularly photographed and fingerprinted, and personal information is collected when they engage in basic activities such as shopping, traveling on airplanes, or even entering some public places. This surveillance encompasses both in-person and online behavior: [End Page 59] The “real-name” system that China has gradually implemented (under the official slogan “Strengthening the construction of network integrity, cultivating the concept of legally operating the internet and using the network with integrity”) will ensure that online activity is open to official scrutiny. Internet companies and regular users alike have their behavior assessed in order to produce a credit rating, and these assessments will serve as the basis for a blacklisting of “enterprises and individuals with serious online dishonesty behaviors.”25 The SCS may also come to incorporate existing blacklists—maintained by websites per official requirements—of internet users whose comments are found to contain “illegal” remarks.26 Through the SCS, Chinese authorities can bundle with a citizen’s national ID code information about matters ranging from tax payments, personal finances, and business registrations to traffic violations and more. Once credit information is linked to documents establishing the personal status of citizens, such as household registrations and ID cards, state authorities as well as the cooperating companies operating social-credit systems can quietly guide and influence behavior. Individuals with good credit records can be rewarded, and those with bad ones may face negative consequences. For example, citizens with unpaid taxes, debts, or traffic fines can be kept from purchasing certain kinds of transportation tickets and rejected when applying for bank loans or credit cards. Measures of this kind have already been put into effect: By mid-2018, due to poor social-credit scores, more than 11 million people had reportedly been placed under limits on the purchase of airline tickets, and 4.25 million people were restricted in buying high-speed rail tickets.27 For those whose political activity draws negative official attention, this system is likely to have serious repercussions. The experiences of individuals currently on social-credit blacklists suggest that those subject to restrictions may not be notified when listed, and will not have easy access to appeal procedures. In China’s one-party dictatorship, there is no independent rule of law, nor are there checks on the government’s power. This means that many of the restraints on the handling of personal data that are present in democratic societies do not apply. Under the new cybersecurity law and other security legislation, authorities can freely access nearly all personal information.28 Once fully operative, the SCS—premised on a massive invasion of citizens’ privacy through large-scale monitoring—will provide the state with a range of new mechanisms by which it can exert control over China’s people. During China’s ongoing wave of digitalization, the country’s tech giants have frequently shown “willingness to share users’ personal data with the state as part of a tacit bargain that allows them to expand with minimal regulatory interference.”29 On 21 October 2016, Alibaba Group chairman Jack Ma told the Central Politics and Law Committee, [End Page 60] a top security body, that “the future legal and security system cannot be separated from the internet and big data.” His remarks, which emphasized crime-fighting, offered support for the vast surveillance project on which PRC authorities have embarked.30 Regulation and other levers give officials considerable influence on corporate decision making in China, and their presence may soon take a more tangible form: A draft document disseminated in 2016 proposed that the government purchase a 1 percent stake in large tech companies and be entitled to representation on their boards. Such an arrangement would amplify the CCP’s voice at the companies to which multitudes of PRC consumers turn for services ranging from online shopping to transportation.31 With the PRC striving to build world-leading industries in AI, big-data analytics, and other emerging fields, high-tech companies that have already been working closely with the government on censorship and surveillance, including Alibaba, Baidu (China’s Google), and Tencent (owner of the widely used messaging and payments app WeChat), are on their way to providing key applications and services worldwide. There are now fifteen countries in which WeChat has begun offering its payment services. In November 2017, Malaysia became the first foreign jurisdiction with access to the platform’s full functionality after Malaysian authorities granted a license that permits WeChat payments through the nation’s banks. WeChat has also become a player in democracies such as Australia, where its payments branch has formed partnerships with local operators of cross-border payment services. Customers in more than ten-thousand Australian restaurants and stores also have the option of paying through WeChat.32 The rapid global expansion of Chinese high-tech companies and their products warrants vigilance for several reasons. First, when users traveling outside the PRC continue to rely on Chinese applications such as WeChat, the applications’ built-in content restrictions travel with them. Second, these platforms can double as tools for information collection. The University of Toronto–based Citizen Lab, for instance, has revealed a number of surveillance mechanisms embedded in Chinese social-media platforms.33 In early December 2017, Indian authorities reportedly instructed armed-service members to avoid 42 apps, including WeChat, on the grounds that “a number of Android/IOS apps developed by Chinese developers or having Chinese links are reportedly either spyware or other malicious ware.”34 This is particular cause for concern since the Chinese government has a dark history of using its high-tech exports for espionage activities. Such activities are part of a broader pattern of high-tech spying: On 11 December 2017, Germany’s intelligence agency accused China of harvesting the personal information of German officials [End Page 61] through the career-networking site LinkedIn.35 Finally, researchers and advocates are rightfully concerned by the prospect that the Chinese government will export its censorship and surveillance technologies, as well as the social-credit system that they have enabled, to other authoritarian governments. In July 2016, President Xi Jin-ping began promoting the concept of the “China model for a better social governance system.” The “China model,” in this case, is nothing but a more appealing term for a comprehensive system of state repression, bolstered by the latest digital technologies and coupled with limited openness in the economic sphere. But the CCP is increasingly self-confident due to its economic success and increased control over society. One telling example of the China model’s influence is that the Wuzhen World Internet Congress, held from 3–5 December 2017, attracted CEOs from leading global tech companies such as Apple, Google, and Cisco Systems. Their presence suggests that these companies are offering their tacit blessing to the China model of managing cyberspace. At the Wuzhen meeting, Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, emphasized “cyber sovereignty” and called on participants not only to “encourage innovation and entrepreneurship” but also, among other points, to “stimulate security cooperation” and “build a good order.”36 Also at Wuzhen, Apple CEO Tim Cook observed that his company’s app store has helped 1.8 million software developers in China to earn collectively US$17 billion in revenue, taking the lead among their peers; Cook failed to mention that more than six-hundred VPN applications had been removed from the app store’s Chinese version in 2017.37 In the past several years, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made several high-profile overtures to Beijing. In December 2014, Zuckerberg hosted “internet czar” Lu Wei, then head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, at Facebook headquarters. During the televised visit, Face-book’s billionaire founder deliberately displayed an English version of President Xi Jinping’s book on his desk. Zuckerberg also met with Xi on 25 September 2015 and asked Xi to choose a Chinese name for his soon-to-be-born daughter. In 2016, the New York Times revealed that Facebook had secretly been at work on software capable of ensuring that users in particular regions—for instance, within China—will not come across certain posts in their news feeds. Facebook clearly undertook this project in order to meet PRC requirements for online censorship.38 [End Page 62] Facebook is not alone in its effort to enter the blocked China market. In August 2018, the Intercept revealed that Google has been preparing a special version of its search service for use in China. This secret initiative, named “Project Dragonfly,” produced an Android app apparently designed to enable Google’s return to China by satisfying official demands, including the blocking of search results and even search terms related to such topics as free speech, protests, democracy, human rights, and religion. Since Google’s project would draw a connection between searches made and individual phone numbers, there are concerns that it would facilitate state surveillance.39 If Facebook and Google indeed enter or re-enter the China market, they will be two perfect examples of the Chinese state’s success in promoting “internet sovereignty.” The 2016 cybersecurity law, which mandates that internet-service operators must store user data and communication content within China, came into effect in June 2017. Apple has already taken action to comply, first declaring its intention to make China’s Guizhou Province the site of an Apple cloud-computing center and then apprising users that a Chinese partner company would be taking over iCloud services in mainland China.40 Combined with requirements to submit to official security assessments and cooperate with official surveillance of “crime,” these mandates for local storage of data would give the government unfettered access to search histories and other personal information regularly acquired by global tech companies. The concessions these companies make might end up endangering those whose searches or messaging contain sensitive content. While Chinese people embrace the convenience brought by a new generation of digital technology, China’s rulers are turning their information, habits, and desires into powerful levers of control. By consolidating vast quantities of data from state agencies, with assistance from such companies as Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent, PRC authorities are well on their way to constructing the world’s largest “dataveillance” infrastructure under the flag of the China model. If the trend toward accommodation of PRC censorship and surveillance requirements continues, global tech companies may soon be making their own contributions to this authoritarian edifice. In July 2017, China’s State Council released a policy plan for attaining global leadership in AI. The PRC aspires to achieve primacy in this cutting-edge field by 2030, investing enough to develop an AI sector worth roughly $150 billion. The State Council document envisions AI “playing an irreplaceable role in effectively maintaining social stability.”41 It anticipates the use of these capabilities not only in such areas as education, healthcare, or environmental protection, but also in [End Page 63] the field of state security, where relevant applications include internet censorship and analyzing surveillance-camera footage to trace people’s movements. As we have noted, AI might also be used to predict protests. Investing in this technology is thus a means for China’s ruling party to firm up its grip on power.42 In February 2018, Xi Jinping orchestrated the elimination from China’s constitution of the two-term limit for the presidency. The addition of digital technology to the apparatus of centralized authoritarianism may well enable Xi to realize his aspiration of holding onto China’s highest office indefinitely. In Xi Jinping’s “Brave New China,” it has become increasingly clear that the digitalization of Chinese society is amplifying the state’s capacity to monitor and control the country’s 1.4 billion people. As PRC authorities augment their formidable collection of high-tech instruments for surveillance and control, they are increasingly cultivating the “ability to persistently link people’s identities and activities.” This is the constant thread running through not only the SCS, but also mandatory real-name registration for internet users; the collection of face, voice, and DNA data; and the ID checks now required in order to perform everyday activities such as mailing a package or getting on a bus.43 A new generation of digital technology, including AI, will empower the state to identify and quash opposition in advance by combining clues from its many channels of mass information collection. In short, China is well on its way to building the world’s first “responsive tyranny,” perhaps even a “digital totalitarian state.”44 Although this may be a dream come true for a dictator hoping to exert maximum control over his society, it is a nightmare for Chinese citizens and for those all over the world who value human freedom.   1. Jon Russell, “China Reaches 800 Million Internet Users,” TechCrunch, 21 August 2018, https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/21/china-reaches-800-million-internet-users. 2. Rachel Botsman, “Big Data Meets Big Brother as China Moves to Rate Its Citizens,” Wired, 21 October 2017, www.wired.co.uk/article/chinese-government-social-credit-score-privacy-invasion. 3. Keith Bradsher, “China Toughens Its Restrictions on Use of the Internet,” New York Times, 28 December 2012. 4. Keith Zhai, “Up to Three Years in Prison for Chinese Internet Users Who Spread Rumours,” South China Morning Post, 10 September 2013; “China Issues New Internet Rules That Include Jail Time,” BBC, 9 September 2013, www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-23990674. 5. “China Employs Two Million Microblog Monitors State Media Say,” BBC, 4 October 2013, www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24396957. 6. Sue-Lin Wong and Michael Martina, “China Adopts Cyber Security Law in Face of Overseas Opposition,” Reuters, 6 November 2016, www.reuters.com/article/us-china-parliament-cyber/china-adopts-cyber-security-law-in-face-of-overseas-opposition-idUSKBN132049. 7. “Youzhong: Wangxinban yuetan shilu” [Daring: The Cyberspace Administration of China’s interview records], China Digital Times, 10 August 2018, https://chinadigitaltimes.net/chinese/2018/08/%E6%9C%89%E7%A8%AE%E4%B8%A8%E7%BD%91%E4%BF%A1%E5%8A%9E%E7%BA%A6%E8%B0%88%E5%AE%9E%E5%BD%95. 8. Information Controls, Global Media Influence, and Cyber Warfare Strategy: Hearing Before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, 115th Cong.

Chinese,https://felenasoft.com/xeoma/en/articles/china-cctv-contemporary-video-surveillance/,49.13827031553913,"â Back to Articles According to the 2021 report by the security researcher Comparitech, 54 percent of the world’s video surveillance cameras – that is 540 million pieces – are installed in China, which means nearly 373 cameras per 1,000 people. In its report, the Indiatimes online magazine ranks the city of Shenzhen in China with its 520 cameras per square mile 4th of the top 20 most surveilled cities in the world. However, the list has 10 more Chinese cities, from Qingdao to Changchun,  out of total 20 while other countries usually only have 1 city – their capital – in the list. Besides, although the UK’s capital, London, tops the list, China’s Taiyuan and Wuxi have more cameras per capita, according to Comparitech. So what is the success story behind the rapid growth of CCTV systems in China and its global dominance? Although factors fueling the growth of technology usually are similar across various countries, China is somewhat different because of its unique political regime and technological might. Western media nicknamed China a Surveillance State, and it is generally pictured as the Orwellian dystopian society with a country-wide grip of control over citizens. Let us look deeper into why video surveillance is so prosperous in China.
 
  First off, the People’s Republic of China (often referred to as the PRC or simply China) is the undeniable global production leader, which includes manufacture and supply of technological equipment and hardware. Lower production prices resulting from the state political regime and industrious workers’ mindset inspired by the country’s ideology have facilitated China to win over competition among other countries. Everyone knows that: if it is the lower price that you are after, you bet you can get it in a Chinese product. Nevertheless, winning the competition is a process since to continue dominating the industry and stay competitive, a producer must always stay on top of the demand, evolving the products to adapt to the modern-day needs. The country being the force for progress makes it super easy for the state to get access to all the advances of technology at reasonable prices, especially since many largest corporations in China are completely or partly state-owned. Local production of what the state will be using, without the costs of import, boosts the economy, creates jobs for citizens, and serves as a staging area for testing of the systems for commercial sales too. So, to conclude, the availability of top-notch video surveillance solutions – both from financial and technical standpoint – is one part of their popularity in China. However, availability is nothing without the demand, and China has plenty of it when it comes to video surveillance. It has been reported by China officials that their goal is to have a digital surveillance apparatus with data about 100% of its population. With over 1.4 billion citizens and the 9,597,000 square kilometers territory, it’s an unimaginably difficult task that calls for any help possible, from innovations in video surveillance equipment to smart analysis techniques – anything that can be shifted some of the work load to. And so there came the solution: the real-time face recognition video analysis, a technology that in some countries only begins to be emerge, is blanketing the country of China and is said to have 1.4-2.5 bln face photos at any given moment. In just a few years after its introduction, use of this software technology quite rapidly has gained momentum and become widespread. Of course, these two prime factors are complemented with the availability and effectiveness of video surveillance for personal and business uses too – although even combined these two realms cannot compete with the share of government in popularization of video surveillance in the People’s Republic of China.  So what exactly makes it so attractive to government, corporations and individuals? We will try to untangle what tasks can video surveillance help with in China below.
 
 Video surveillance was invented as a natural response to communal crimes and violence acts. Nowadays, various ‘Safe city’ programs around the world are known to be state efforts aimed at social stability maintenance. Chinese policing system, too, boasts that facial-recognition systems regularly catch crooks. That can be true: even the perception of video surveillance presence can prevent crime and deter social unrest – just like it does make shoplifters seek an easier target without video surveillance rather than steal under the cameras and risk leaving a trail of evidence behind.  As any country, China has some internal issues. For example, due to former child birth policy, there had been a boost of kidnapping in the country at some time. Fortified by video surveillance and artificial intelligence, police gets vast powers to track criminals or drug smugglers, and aid criminal investigations, for example, to find abducted children, or to improve traffic management.  Enforcing traffic rules and promoting safe driving habits is a life-saving duty. Luckily, with video surveillance systems, many tasks can be automated. For example, patrol cars of the police officials can be equipped with smart dash cams that single out license plates of missing cars from the everyday vehicle traffic flow. City cameras hanging on every pole can be on the automated lookout for illegal parking, traffic rules violations like overspeeding, lane crossing, etc. – and work in combination with fining systems in the fully standalone mode. Let alone that recordings can be used for forensic purposes or a city-wide search. The state-of-the-art video surveillance software like Xeoma  has these and many other traffic control tools.  Besides, mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight terrorism (preferably – to deter it), especially in societies with historical ethnicity conflicts. Apart from the regular security monitoring of strategic areas, proactive video analytics can detect if a suspicious object has been left unattended in public spaces, especially those of mass gathering like airports or public transportation stations. Another example is artificial intelligence techniques which, when trained to detect weapons, can spot a person carrying a gun early on – and report it to the nearest police squad.  There’s also the duty of border security where smart cameras with video analytics on board can be a great aid in improving the level of security. The range of video analytics expertise is vast: from scanning the travellers faces for signs of aggression or nervousness, catching glimpse of weaponry or restricted import/export products, to automated access control systems with vehicle license plate recognition and scheduled patrols of land or sea borders with FPV drones. Maintaining internal law and order is an important duty of any state that wants to make the country a secure and safe place for its citizens to operate in, so China dedicates much resources to that sphere of life.
 
 Prevention of crimes is proven to be more effective and beneficial in the long run than post-incident investigation. And probably the most effective strategy of deterring crime is the so called Behavioral engineering – combination of psychological and technological tactics to form a pattern for acceptable behavior among people, thus rooting out whatever is perceived as âuncivilized behaviorâ. Video surveillance systems installed at crosswalks in China have been used for detection of jaywalking (crossing the street in prohibited places) – a minor offence, as some might think, but with disastrous consequences in places with high traffic. There are incidents where cameras helped fight the habit of public spitting, wearing pajamas on the street (a traditional fashion that the authorities attempt to fight), or even wasting toilet paper. China’s CCTV systems even facilitate fighting the âBeijing bikiniâ practice when men bare their bellies by rolling up their shirts in the summer. Isn’t it showing the great potential of detecting not just types of objects but also various types of unusual behavior? But it wouldn’t be that effective if not for the Chinese nationwide network of cameras being synchronized with a biometric database powered by facial recognition, which, in combination, does identification of people caught on camera, so the offenders can be found even if they manage to flee scene of the crime, and get a warning or a fine depending on the severity of their offence. Speaking of behavior, contemporary video surveillance solutions like Xeoma which was not developed in China but can make a decent competition to Chinese know-hows with its innovative features, offers behavior analysis that can recognize if a person is in camera sight acting weird, has angry mood, etc.  All in all, experts say that harnessing vast inputs of behavioral data can affect behavior of the population to shape it in a way to create predictive policing and safe, stable societies.
 Let’s not forget that there are more dimensions of public safety than prevention and investigation of criminal activity. For example, China has shown great results in handling the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to the disciplinary and technological measures erected. A raft of digital Covid-tracking tools has been put in place to facilitate control over social distance, stay time and quarantine recommendations. It was reported that law enforcement officials wore “smart helmets” with an AI-powered infrared camera embedded in the front to detect pedestrians’ temperature amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Video surveillance thermal cameras could be used to substitute workers that do temperature check at building entrances and are more than likely to catch and spread the disease, thus eliminating health hazards and restraining the epidemic. Another technological breakthrough was the “smart glasses” also equipped with facial and license plates recognition capabilities and the ability to scan QR codes. Live raw data from the cameras and various trackers was interconnected with the citywide databases of people who have a confirmed coronavirus case, are in quarantine, or suspected to have been in contact with a COVID patient.  The smart glasses and helmets with video surveillance cameras can also spot missing or wanted people in a crowd: criminal offenders or mentally ill people, people with the history of child abuse or drug use. Regular stationary cameras in public spaces now feature really smart video analytics that can make conclusions drawn from multiple suspicions. Examples include smart systems that can suspect possible case of prostitution if a woman checks into multiple hotels in one night, or catch unlicensed tour guides.
Advanced video analytical CCTV systems can even make out different animals be it pigs in a corral, pandas in a zoo, or falcons or horses in competitive animal sport to prevent frauds. Besides the common intrusion detection (which can be set up to trigger at any motion events, in night-time, or upon detection of specific types of objects), modern video analytics can be deployed to fulfil tasks like recognize a fire hazard, identify people doing high-rise littering, stop graffiti artists or vandals, etc.
 If outdoor video surveillance cameras have got the criminal activities that occur in streets and roads covered, there are also governmental and privately owned establishments that need protection of both assets and people. And truly, video surveillance handles indoor security as well as safety on the streets. See for yourself: medical facilities can have video analytics allowing to spot long queues that call for service optimization. Smart tools like slip and fall detector can detect if someone has fainted, etc. Facial recognition can be used for post-incident investigation, or for on-time notification about the appearance of a wanted criminal. Schools and kindergartens can embark on the advances of artificial intelligence monitoring the premises for signs of weaponry or strangers. Besides, AI can be a tool to gather information on staff performance as well as enhance student engagement. Technologies like Face ID can be put to good use in the educational institutions for automation of entrance to campuses or buildings.
 
 The industrial  sector in China is abundant with various production units like plants and factories since the country is the world’s top exporter of equipment, clothing, footwear, furniture, plastic products, machine parts and tires, and accessorizes. To produce so many goods the country possesses over numerous refineries, warehouses, and similar facilities. CCTV systems powered by video analytics can not only do the regular job of ensuring proactive intrusion detection, criminal acts prevention and provision of video footage for forensic uses in such facilities. Thanks to latest developments, there are so many uses of  video surveillance in China’s industrial sphere to improve production operations and outcomes, optimize processes, and automate routine tasks.  Proactive monitoring can be on the lookout for early signs of hazards like fire or smoke, ensuring compliance with safety and health regulations, control over productivity and filtering out faulty products reduce various types of losses. Besides, monitoring of the staff activities is known to have a reserving effect on workers thus creating a more productive atmosphere or at least cutting down losses caused by fraud, theft, or irresponsible behavior. For export-oriented manufacturing, especially in heavy machinery, remote acceptance features of video surveillance might be of great use, along with the regular trespassing detection in off-hours or 24/7 monitoring that CCTV provides. Besides, license plate recognition and recognition of faces that work in combination with turnstile and gate barrier equipment can partly or completely replace a security guard with automated access control to the territory.
 
 Although the communist regime of the PRC used to rule out privately owned companies some time ago, this is no longer the case in contemporary China, and there is a place for non-governmental business too. With modern CCTV solutions, businesses of various scale and various domains – from hospitality and real estate to entertainment and food industry – can unlock unprecedented opportunities of how to increase security and safety levels, boost productivity and improve operational efficiency, as well as have the machines do routine work instead of human workers. CCTV systems with AI are a great aid in tackling away various challenges faced by businesses, whether in offices or retail outlets, productions or transportation units, HoReCa or entertainment establishments. Businesses that are equipped with video surveillance systems face less burglaries or cashier frauds, while at the same time are endowed with vital statistics on the potential and existing clientele. Unique visitors calculator relies on the already mentioned Face Recognition algorithms and help estimate how many new customers visit the establishment in the selected time range. With live demographics analytics, a business owner can have valuable data on their clients and their tastes. The Emotions Recognition can show unbiased truth of staff performance and customers satisfaction levels.  Along with the above mentioned tools, the banking and financial institutions can benefit from CCTV systems by remastering them into a hi-tech panic button as well. Also, the Smoke Detector in Xeoma video surveillance systems has the âFire detectionâ add-on powered by artificial intelligence so it can detect either smoke or fire in an area â a waiting hall or offices. Sound recognition used in tandem with custom notification modules of Xeoma will notify authorized personnel or call the police if it recognizes screams or gunshots. Alternatively, with a simpler sound detector, the system can react to high levels of sound volume that can be a signal of a stressful environment and tension, or of a critical issue with bank appliances.
 
 Since China is generally perceived as the Surveillance State, it is supposed that Chinese population is tired of overwhelming camera supervision so there are hardly any mentions of private use of video surveillance in the country. However, CCTV systems are so affordable, broad-ranged and widespread in China that it’s hard to resist the temptation of having a personal anti-burglar system that makes your home always reachable over the Internet. Whether you want to see how your pets are getting along without you throughout the work day, track deliveries or keep an eye on your elderly, contemporary video surveillance like Xeoma has got the answer. With dozens of reactions available – from mobile push notifications to custom reactions like VoIP call to rescue services – tenants can sleep peacefully at night knowing that Xeoma will let them know if there is an alarming episode.
 The virtues of video surveillance systems in China are clear: advanced video analytics can help in securing cities, optimization of business operations and automatization of routine or hazardous tasks, or duties that need split-second decisions. However, it is the Napoleonian plans of the China government to continue extension of the facial recognition system so that it eventually covers all population that may provoke further challenges and issues. Here’s what remains to be worked on: Unprecedented data fusion
The world’s famous state facial recognition systems of the PRC is not just detecting faces and comparing it to citizens’ profiles. The smart cameras can also recognize someoneâs race, gender, clothing, vehicles, or if people in camera frame are wearing glasses, masks, or various face modifications like moustache or hats. Moreover, the authorities are building upon facial recognition technology even further by making it work in combination with various trackers like phone-tracking devices that are now everywhere, scanning phones of passers-by, collecting mobile device information and âvirtual identities,â such as MAC addresses, phone numbers, WeChat accounts, e-commerce payments, etc. In result, the authorities in China can scan your phones and detect someone’s face, combine it with geographic information source (GIS) data, and then track people’s movements and their social connections, know everything about your comings and goings – for example, when you leave your home. Furthermore, the Chinese police is reported to be creating one of the world’s largest DNA databases, and there are confirmed plans of the authorities to collect voice prints from the general public too. Imagine how much processing power and storage capacities it takes to store a detailed account of comings and goings of a 1.4 bln population every second, and double it with data on them from phone trackers, voice prints, DNA and medical records, social media correspondence (even deleted messages are said to be kept)… Each of these databases is huge, and it requires a massive amount of effort, resources and hardware to fuse these massive amounts of data gathered from multifaceted sources into one functioning whole. Expert anticipate that this fusion might take some time, to say the least, because the appetite for varied databases might yet be aggravated with more types of data that can be gathered from the public. Centralization
It’s not just the unimaginable hardware requirements that make this data fusion so hard to achieve; it’s also the technological solutions it requires. For now, the China’s provinces have their separate scope of responsibilities and decisions as to the video surveillance systems, the databases they collect and store, and how they use them. The data had not been centralized, but it needs to be if the authorities want to make this great data fusion happen. The challenge to improve consolidation to a federal level is all about uniting local authorities to work in close connection so that big data coming from all kind of sources is stored, processed, maintained in and retrieved from one central station.  Data security and adequate access regulation Complicated systems of gathering as much information about the public as China government does, involve thousands of contractors and workers that turn out to have some amount of access to the pieces of information they are working with. Privacy rights advocates and China experts highlight that in that respect access to sensitive data is not regulated well enough in some cases. It leads to the possibility of the information being misused, leaked or taken advantage of. This lays bare some of the most profound risks to human rights. To negate these risks and do away with privacy concerns, the state needs to work out a valid data handling policy and set a round of officials responsible for flawless operation of the consolidated big data system.
 China is an AI surveillance technology’s top exporter, providing the technology to 63 countries, and a major supplier of basic surveillance platforms to more than 80 countries.
Video surveillance solutions help to unlock unprecedented opportunities to deter and catch criminals, protect national security, fight terrorism and crimes, instill a pattern for civilized behavior, and improve many operations, in business, private or municipal life.  Technologies powered by artificial intelligence (like recognition of intrusion, faces, vehicles, emotions, abnormal and hazardous situations, etc.) propelled Chinaâs exports to a new level and gave the world a blueprint for how to build large databases with information from all sorts of sources. Considering the pace of AI evolution, it is to be anticipated that there will be plenty of useful life-saving development in the future too, continuing the prosperity of video surveillance systems in China and throughout the world.

Western,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/china-surveillance/552203/,-0.17967380109941053,"The country is perfecting a vast network of digital espionage as a means of social control—with implications for democracies worldwide. Imagine a society in which you are rated by the government on your trustworthiness. Your “citizen score” follows you wherever you go. A high score allows you access to faster internet service or a fast-tracked visa to Europe. If you make political posts online without a permit, or question or contradict the government’s official narrative on current events, however, your score decreases. To calculate the score, private companies working with your government constantly trawl through vast amounts of your social media and online shopping data. When you step outside your door, your actions in the physical world are also swept into the dragnet: The government gathers an enormous collection of information through the video cameras placed on your street and all over your city. If you commit a crime—or simply jaywalk—facial recognition algorithms will match video footage of your face to your photo in a national ID database. It won’t be long before the police show up at your door. This society may seem dystopian, but it isn’t farfetched: It may be China in a few years. The country is racing to become the first to implement a pervasive system of algorithmic surveillance. Harnessing advances in artificial intelligence and data mining and storage to construct detailed profiles on all citizens, China’s communist party-state is developing a “citizen score” to incentivize “good” behavior. A vast accompanying network of surveillance cameras will constantly monitor citizens’ movements, purportedly to reduce crime and terrorism. While the expanding Orwellian eye may improve “public safety,” it poses a chilling new threat to civil liberties in a country that already has one of the most oppressive and controlling governments in the world. China’s evolving algorithmic surveillance system will rely on the security organs of the communist party-state to filter, collect, and analyze staggering volumes of data flowing across the internet. Justifying controls in the name of national security and social stability, China originally planned to develop what it called a “Golden Shield” surveillance system allowing easy access to local, national, and regional records on each citizen. This ambitious project has so far been mostly confined to a content-filtering Great Firewall, which prohibits foreign internet sites including Google, Facebook, and The New York Times. According to Freedom House, China’s level of internet freedom is already the worst on the planet. Now, the Communist Party of China is finally building the extensive, multilevel data-gathering system it has dreamed of for decades. While the Chinese government has long scrutinized individual citizens for evidence of disloyalty to the regime, only now is it beginning to develop comprehensive, constantly updated, and granular records on each citizen’s political persuasions, comments, associations, and even consumer habits. The new social credit system under development will consolidate reams of records from private companies and government bureaucracies into a single “citizen score” for each Chinese citizen. In its comprehensive 2014 planning outline, the CCP explains a goal of “keep[ing] trust and constraints against breaking trust.” While the system is voluntary for now, it will be mandatory by 2020. Already, 100,000 Chinese citizens have posted on social media about high scores on a “Sesame Credit” app operated by Alibaba, in a private-sector precursor to the proposed government system. The massive e-commerce conglomerate claims its app is only tracking users’ financial and credit behavior, but promises to offer a “holistic rating of character.” It is not hard to imagine many Chinese boasting soon about their official scores. While it isn’t yet clear what data will be considered, commentators are already speculating that the scope of the system will be alarmingly wide. The planned “citizen credit” score will likely weigh far more data than the Western FICO score, which helps lenders make fast and reliable decisions on whether to extend financial credit. While the latter simply tracks whether you’ve paid back your debts and managed your money well, experts on China and internet privacy have speculated—based on the vast amounts of online shopping data mined by the government without regard for consumer privacy—that your Chinese credit score could be higher if you buy items the regime likes—like diapers—and lower if you buy ones it doesn’t, like video games or alcohol. Well beyond the realm of online consumer purchasing, your political involvement could also heavily affect your score: Posting political opinions without prior permission or even posting true news that the Chinese government dislikes could decrease your rank. Even more worrying is that the government will be technically capable of considering the behavior of a Chinese citizen’s friends and family in determining his or her score. For example, it is possible that your friend’s anti-government political post could lower your own score. Thus, the scoring system would isolate dissidents from their friends and the rest of society, rendering them complete pariahs. Your score might even determine your access to certain privileges taken for granted in the U.S., such as a visa to travel abroad or or even the right to travel by train or plane within the country. One internet privacy expert warns: “What China is doing here is selectively breeding its population to select against the trait of critical, independent thinking.” While Westerners and especially civil liberties groups like the ACLU are horrified by such a prospect—one commentator called the possibility “authoritarianism, gamified”—others argue that because lack of trust is a serious problem in China, many Chinese welcome this potential system. However, a state-run, party-inspired, data-driven monitoring system poses profound questions for the West about the role of private companies in government surveillance. Is it ethical for private companies to assist in massive surveillance and turn over their data to the government? Alibaba (China’s Amazon) and Tencent (owner of the popular messaging platform WeChat) possess sweeping data on each Chinese citizen that the government would have to mine to calculate scores. Although Chinese companies now are required to assist in government spying while U.S. companies are not, it is possible to imagine Amazon in Alibaba’s position, or Facebook in place of Tencent. While private companies like credit scoring bureaus have always used data to measure consumers’ creditworthiness, in any decent society there must be a clear distinction between private-sector and public-sector scoring mechanisms that could determine access to citizen rights and privileges, without recourse. This planned data-focused social credit system is only one facet of China’s rapidly expanding system of algorithmic surveillance. Another is a sprawling network of technologies, especially surveillance cameras, to monitor people’s physical movements. In 2015, China’s national police force—the Ministry of Public Safety—called for the creation of an “omnipresent, completely connected, always on and fully controllable” national video surveillance network. MPS and other agencies stated that law enforcement should use facial recognition technology in combination with the video cameras to catch lawbreakers. One IHS Markit estimate puts the number of cameras in China at 176 million today, with a plan to have 450 million installed by 2020. One hundred percent of Beijing is now blanketed by surveillance cameras, according to the Beijing Public Safety Bureau. The stated goal of this system is to capture and deter criminals. However, it also poses obvious and massive risks to privacy and the modicum of freedom Chinese citizens have managed to gain since the Maoist era. The penalties for small crimes seem unreasonable: Authorities in Fuzhou are publishing the names of jaywalkers in local media and even sending them to their employers. More ominous, though, are the likely punishments that will be inflicted on people who associate with dissidents or critics, who circulate a petition or hold up a protest sign, or who simply wind up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Thus, the installation of an all-seeing-eye for the government alarms civil liberties and privacy advocates worldwide. The government already constantly monitors the cell phones and social media of human-rights activists in the name of “stability maintenance.” A video surveillance system would enable further pervasive and repressive surveillance. Making streams publicly available, too, would threaten every citizen’s privacy: A busybody neighbor could easily spy on the activities of the family next door as they run errands or go on vacation. China’s experiments with digital surveillance pose a grave new threat to freedom of expression on the internet and other human rights in China. Increasingly, citizens will refrain from any kind of independent or critical expression for fear that their data will be read or their movements recorded—and penalized—by the government. And that is exactly the point of the program. Moreover, what emerges in China will not stay in China. Its repressive technologies have a pattern of diffusing to other authoritarian regimes around the world. For this reason—not to mention concern for the hundreds of millions of people in China whose meager freedom will be further diminished—democracies around the world must monitor and denounce this sinister creep toward an Orwellian world.",13,1,6,2,5,1,0,0,3,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Chinese Premier Li Qiang has signed a State Council decree to issue the regulations, which comprise 34 articles and will come into effect on April 1. The regulations aim to govern the management of public security video image information systems, maintain public safety, and protect personal privacy and rights and interests of personal information, according to the regulations. Public security video systems refer to systems that collect, transmit, display and store video image information related to public safety, read the regulations. The regulations stipulate that the construction and utilization of such systems must neither pose a threat to national security or public interests, nor encroach upon the legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations. According to the regulations, the installation of cameras and related facilities inside guest rooms or private compartments in hotels and restaurants is prohibited. Additionally, the installation of cameras is banned in student dormitories, public bathrooms, washrooms, changing rooms, fitting rooms, and other areas where it is possible to photograph, peep, or eavesdrop on the privacy of others, read the regulations. The regulations specify that product and service providers of public security video systems shall not install malicious programs, and clearly require that prominent warning signs should be set up at the camera installation sites. The management units of public security video systems shall fulfill their responsibilities for the safe operation of the systems, as well as their obligations to safeguard cybersecurity and data security and to protect personal information, read the document. According to the document, the management units shall protect state secrets, commercial secrets, personal privacy and personal information when using video image information. It also prohibited the provision or public dissemination of video image information collected by public security video systems, illegally intruding into or controlling the system, or unlawfully obtaining data from it by any organization or individual.

Jointly released by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and the Ministry of Public Security, the measures will go into effect on June 1, 2025. The document sets forth basic requirements and processing rules for the use of facial recognition technology in handling facial data, security standards for the application of the technology, as well as relevant supervisory and management responsibilities. Notably, regarding mandatory facial recognition, an issue of wide concern which often occurs at hotel check-ins and residence area entrances, the document introduces a non-mandatory principle, stipulating that facial recognition cannot be the sole verification method if ""the same purpose or business requirement can be achieved through other non-facial recognition methods."" If individuals do not consent to identity verification through facial recognition, they should be provided with other reasonable and convenient alternatives, according to the measures. Facial recognition data is sensitive personal information, and once it is leaked, it can cause significant harm to individuals' personal and property security, and even pose a threat to public safety, said an official with the CAC. The measures were introduced as facial recognition becomes increasingly common across consumption, finance and transportation, thanks to the rapid development of internet technologies, according to the official. While this has contributed to the growth of the digital economy and facilitated people's lives, it has also raised concerns about privacy and the leakage of personal information, drawing widespread attention from all sectors of society, the official said. China has attached great significance to the protection of personal information. The law on the protection of personal information, which took effect in November 2021, stipulates that national cyberspace authorities shall coordinate relevant authorities to formulate specific personal information protection rules for new technologies and applications, including facial recognition. Rules for the processing of personal information have also been included in laws and administrative regulations such as the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law and the regulations on network data security management. ""The formulation and introduction of the measures is an important step in implementing the provisions of these laws and administrative regulations,"" the CAC official said.

Chinese,https://www.chinafile.com/state-surveillance-china,5.385061682267042,"Ai Weiwei, ‘Surveillance Camera,’ 2010. Key Takeaways Budgeting for Surveillance Cameras and Software The Surveillance Bureaucracy Methodology Primary Sources: Xiqiao Township’s Hierarchy of Human Needs “Xiqiao Township Facial Recognition System Construction Program” (Chinese) “2017 Harbin City Xiangfang District Public Security Branch Bureau Project Skynet Video Surveillance System Construction Program” (Chinese) “Xinjiang Shawan County Smart (Safe) Project Feasibility Study” (Chinese) Additional Data: Official PRC Place Names High atop Mount Xiqiao, an extinct volcano that soars above the Pearl River Delta, a towering statue of the Buddhist goddess Guanyin gazes down on the concrete sprawl of the city of Foshan. For centuries, the mountain’s scenic caves and waterfalls provided a refuge for scholars and artists. But today, Xiqiao is a far more crowded place. Some five million tourists visit each year. And as they wend their way up the mountain through groves of peach and banyan, Guanyin is not the only one keeping watch. In 2019, local officials in Xiqiao, a district of Foshan, devised a plan for the ideal placement of surveillance cameras throughout their jurisdiction. A visitor making an ascent of Mount Xiqiao might first have her face captured by one of the three cameras at the Xiqiao bus station, and again at the bus stop closest to the mountain’s base. If she followed the usual route, a camera could next catch her entering the Qiaoyuan public bathroom, resting a moment to admire the Tingyinhu waterfall, or stopping in for a snack at the Qiaoshan hotel. All together, Xiqiao’s police would have at least nine chances to collect images of this visitor’s face during her journey. And when she reached the summit, a tenth camera, mounted just beside Guanyin’s own serene visage, would snap a final shot. Over the past five years, local Communist Party officials charged with maintaining “social stability” in Xiqiao have planned purchases of surveillance technology to blanket their town with cameras. This would help bring about a “breakthrough in addressing the difficult problem of how to control people,” explained a document outlining Xiqiao’s desired purchases. Government records show that officials made at least six separate surveillance equipment purchases between 2006 and 2019, with the goal of installing at least 1,400 cameras throughout Xiqiao, including 300 facial recognition cameras last year alone. Xiqiao may be just a small district of a fairly ordinary Chinese city (albeit one on the leading edge of surveillance practice in China), but the worries and aspirations of its officials are hardly unique. Rather, they reflect a profound unease among China’s leaders about what can happen when the country’s citizens go unwatched. Across China, in its most crowded cities and tiniest hamlets, this has led to an unprecedented surveillance shopping spree by government officials. The coordination of the resulting millions of cameras and other snooping technology spread across the country remains partial at best, its efficacy uncertain. Yet, despite these limitations, officials in China are working to make the system as effective and advanced as possible. These are among the key findings of ChinaFile’s analysis of some 76,000 government procurement notices and corresponding documents related to the purchases of surveillance technology by both central and local governments across China between 2004 and mid-May 2020—the most comprehensive accounting of China’s surveillance build-up to date. In 2015, a national policy document issued by nine different Party and government bureaucracies called for “public safety video-surveillance construction, networking, and applications” across China. The policy described such surveillance systems as not only a way to combat crime, but also an important mechanism for enhancing “social management” and “safeguarding national security and social stability.” “Given the growing openness of society, the increasing convenience and speed of transportation infrastructure, and the widespread adoption of various emerging communication technologies,” as numerous government documents and media reports put it, using identical language, “people with all kinds of interests can cross jurisdictions to band together, stir up trouble, and assemble illegally. This presents a serious challenge to preventing, perceiving, and predicting vicious crimes and mass incidents.” To combat these dangers, China’s National Development and Reform Commission embarked on a project called “Xueliang Gongcheng,” or “Project Sharp Eyes” (evoking Mao Zedong’s aphorism that celebrated people who spied on one another). Building on and supplementing Project Skynet, Safe Cities, and other previous surveillance campaigns, China’s government aims to extend video surveillance coverage to 100 percent of China’s “key public spaces” by the end of this year. Unsurprisingly, the enterprise has become a subject for analysis as sweeping and grandiose as its own ambition, analysis that too often mistakes official rhetoric for results. However fervently they might desire it, China’s leaders have not built an all-seeing, all-knowing panopticon capable of tracking anyone in the country, anywhere, at any time. Journalists and advocacy groups have rightly focused much of their surveillance reporting on the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where China’s government has constructed a radically invasive system to monitor the region’s ethnic minority Muslims. What has been far harder to see are the details of the surveillance buildup elsewhere in the country. To what degree is Xinjiang a model for the rest of the People’s Republic of China (PRC)? Who, exactly, are local governments elsewhere trying to track? Why do they think such surveillance is necessary? How much does the application of national surveillance plans vary from place to place? How costly is it to local governments? And how well do any of these systems actually work? These were some of the questions ChinaFile sought to answer in its analysis of procurement notices from the Chinese Government Procurement Network website, where they are made public to allow companies to bid to fulfil them. In addition to itemizing the devices, software, and maintenance services officials seek to purchase, as well as noting final purchase prices and names of winning companies, many procurement notices include lengthy addenda which reveal how officials shopping for, say, thermal-imaging cameras, WiFi sniffers, or facial recognition software understand the purpose of their investments, how they think about public safety, and how they evaluate their current ability to achieve it.

To be sure, what officials propose and even ultimately purchase is far from an infallible predictor of what they install or how effectively they deploy it. The capacity of China’s government, both at the central and local level, has limits. It is provisional, bounded by the mundane realities of bureaucracy and governance: time, money, competing priorities, and human error. While local officials frequently echo the broader goals of their bosses in Beijing, they must also contend with realities on their home turf. Still, though procurement notices can’t perfectly measure surveillance capacity on the ground, they do offer an excellent view of the government’s intent. In their aggregate and in the richness of their individual details, the tens of thousands of notices ChinaFile analyzed sharpen what has been a blurry picture of this highly consequential aspect of Chinese governance. Together, they paint a stark portrait of a leadership craving the ability to penetrate ever deeper into Chinese citizens’ private lives and animated by fear of a population on the move. They also portray the leadership’s utmost confidence—faith even—that if only it possesses sufficient quantities of the right technology, then there exists no threat it cannot detect and eliminate. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, with its attendant lockdowns, contact tracing, and health assessments, has only intensified this impulse. China is not the only country that surveils its citizens, of course, and not the only place where surveillance technology, such as predictive policing, leads to human rights abuses. At the same time, says Daragh Murray, an expert in conflict, artificial intelligence, and international human rights law at the University of Essex, unlike their counterparts in the United States and the United Kingdom, authorities in China use such technology “within a much broader repressive infrastructure . . . a system attuned to repression.” Purchases of surveillance technology reached a high-water mark in 2018 and 2019. This included not just cameras, but access to predictive policing software, smartphone forensic systems, and platforms intended to knit together the data they collected. The evidence for this derives from awarded bid notices—that is, announcements of which companies won government contracts. Authorities in at least 998 counties—one third of all counties in China—in nearly every corner of the country purchased surveillance equipment of some type in 2019 alone. Local governments’ purchasing of facial recognition systems is growing more prevalent across China, complementing their ever-increasing procurement of conventional video surveillance systems.  The awarded bid notices ChinaFile analyzed also hint at how much money central and local governments are committing to the surveillance push: Notices dated between 2016 and 2020 that referenced Sharp Eyes resulted in expenditures of more than 14 billion renminbi (U.S.$2.1 billion), a figure which doesn’t include spending on other surveillance projects. Local governments’ surveillance spending varied widely, fluctuating over time, sometimes reaching the equivalent of half of total public security expenses in a given year.  Not content to leave the monitoring of China’s citizens in the sole hands of law enforcement, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) entities also buy their own equipment, installing surveillance systems that feed into broader local monitoring apparatuses, but that are under the direct purview of the Party.1 At the same time, however, officials’ shopping for technology to integrate disconnected local systems shows the extent to which surveillance in China is not yet a coherent whole, but remains an unfinished patchwork. To capture both the ambitions and the day-to-day realities of this surveillance project, ChinaFile focused its reporting on three very different locations. The procurement notices from each locality include particularly detailed supplemental materials that illuminate important and distinct aspects of China’s surveillance regime. A scheme for deploying facial recognition infrastructure in the town of Xiqiao reveals aspects of the philosophical underpinnings of the system at large, including what types of people authorities view as dangerous. In Shawan county, in Xinjiang, authorities’ plan for an extensive new surveillance system throws into relief the extent to which the region’s extreme surveillance regime is—and is not—an outlier when compared to the rest of China. A notice seeking software in the northeastern city of Harbin shows officials working to expand their surveillance capacities to predict where their fellow residents will go and what they will do. Though it remains uncertain how effective these technologies are, the intent is clear: to eliminate any public spaces where people might remain unwatched. * * * Last year in Xiqiao, a town in Guangdong province of roughly 300,000 people, officials set out to build what they dubbed a “portrait perception network.” The plan called for the purchase of 300 cameras compatible with facial recognition software, along with additional equipment such as lights and poles, and the rental of fiber optic cables.  Vigilance was necessary, the designers of the scheme reasoned, because of the inherent dangers posed by everyday human activity. “Society is a collection of individuals, and of the interactions among individuals,” a July 2019 procurement notice from Xiqiao’s Comprehensive Management, Petitioning, and Stability Maintenance Office explained cryptically. “All kinds of phenomena that emerge within societies result from human interaction: violence, robbery, arson, etc.”  Thus, the cameras would be arrayed to align with the “four basic needs” of human life: food, clothing, housing, and transportation and five additional “quality-of-life needs”: healthcare; finance; arts, education, and culture; entertainment; and leisure travel. Xiqiao would install its new facial recognition cameras at the entrances and exits of restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls, bus stations, kindergartens, movie theaters, and even a martial arts gym—where they could detect the faces of passers-by and feed these “portraits” back into a larger monitoring system. Atop this hierarchy of needs, the township’s plans layered another rubric for camera placement, classifying their district’s public places according to the ease with which people could be surveilled while passing through them. “Core” points, such as security checkpoints at airports or subway stations, where people would be likely to line up in a relatively orderly fashion, would provide opportunities for well-placed cameras to get a clear shot of faces one by one. Monitoring of these “core” points would allow authorities to know who was entering or exiting the township in real time. “Key points” were areas in schools, hospitals, hotels, shopping malls, entertainment venues, and other places characterized by wide passages, disordered and unrestricted flow of people, groups passing through, and a certain peak of pedestrian traffic. “Auxiliary areas,” such as sidewalks, crosswalks, or scenic areas which often lacked a single point of entry or exit, would likely be disorderly, complicating efforts to snoop on the people thronging through them. Applying this taxonomy correctly would ensure no one going about their business in town would escape notice.  The philosophy behind this camera placement, though expressed with particular clarity in the Xiqiao notice, appears elsewhere in China as well. In Xiqiao’s neighboring district of Shunde, officials sought in 2018 to create a “three-dimensional prevention and control network” centered on “face big data,” with images being collected at hospitals, schools, transit hubs, and places of business. Notably, the Shunde document stated that guidance from national and provincial authorities helped determine the placement of facial recognition cameras. Is this type of surveillance unique to China? As the cost of computing gets cheaper, and data collection becomes more expansive, the “proactive panopticon, which tries to figure out ahead of time who is a danger,” is becoming more common across the world, says Albert Fox Cahn, founder of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project. At the same time, however, plenty of countries with the resources to invest in this kind of surveillance have not done so due to various legal, political, or social constraints. “The well-justified focus on China in this space can make it appear to be more of an outlier, or more of a singular driver, than it is,” Cahn notes. “The thing that sets China apart is not that it has incentives to monitor. It’s that there’s no countervailing price to doing so openly.” * * * The PRC’s leaders have always excelled at surveilling their countrymen, and this lack of a “countervailing price” has allowed them to do so in varied ways over the past 70 years. During the first few decades of the PRC’s existence, the state-controlled labor system tethered workers and their families to their places of employment; changing jobs, let alone relocating to another part of the country at will, rarely proved possible. The danwei, or work unit, was not only a place of employment, it also distributed housing, social services, and other state benefits. Moreover, work units served as the eyes of the state, maintaining their residents’ dossiers, compiling information about them at work, at mandatory Party meetings, and in their homes—information often supplied by neighbors and coworkers. Reporting on members of one’s own community reached frenzied heights during the Cultural Revolution, when people had to publicly accuse their acquaintances, friends, and even loved ones of real or imagined political transgressions in order to avoid becoming targets themselves. Once Deng Xiaoping set the country on a path to economic reform in the late 1970s, allowing individuals to conduct private business transactions and move somewhat more freely around the country, state monitoring of citizens eased up by necessity. For a few decades, Chinese citizens became accustomed to relatively more robust levels of personal privacy. Now, as China’s government acquires better tools to help authorities keep watch, it is gradually regaining the ability to monitor large swathes of the population at one time. “The thing that sets China apart is not that it has incentives to monitor. It’s that there’s no countervailing price to doing so openly.”   Chinese citizens know they are being watched. An opt-in online survey conducted by the Nandu Personal Information Protection Research Centre in Beijing found in 2019 that respondents had mixed feelings about the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces. Around two-thirds of respondents “somewhat agreed” or “strongly agreed” that facial recognition had made public transit, school campuses, shopping areas, and common areas of housing units safer. At the same time, 80 percent expressed concern about potentially lax data security practices, while 57 percent worried their “personal whereabouts could be tracked.” Even before the advent of facial recognition software, the PRC had begun to implement the tracking and reporting infrastructure known as “grid management.” In some ways, the grid management system furnishes the low-tech foundation upon which the current surveillance structure rests. First piloted in a few select cities over a decade ago, grid management takes its cues from earlier Chinese systems of social control, carving up a given locality into smaller, more controllable units such as neighborhoods and apartment compounds. Within these units, government-employed workers monitor local populations, facilities, civil society groups, as well as residents’ concerns and report anything noteworthy to their higher-ups. Speaking to the press on the expansion of grid management in his city in 2016, Guangzhou’s former mayor posited that, “if a grid administrator is responsible for 200 families, he can roughly remember who is in his grid in one month’s time and grasp the basic information of each family in about three months’ time. In six months’ time, he can count every member of those families.” China’s media has widely heralded grid management as a solution to illegal behavior, problems with government service provision, safety issues, and “petitioning and stability maintenance,” allowing local authorities to quickly determine if an undesirable visitor, such as a journalist reporting on a chemical spill, for example, has entered their jurisdiction. It is in this environment, with the expectation that lower-level officials should have a fairly detailed understanding of their residents’ normal range of activities, that local governments are investing in new surveillance technologies—including software that allows them to automatically identify and track people going about their daily lives. In one particularly evocative description, a feasibility study commissioned by public security officials in Xinjiang described video surveillance as “extending the capacity of the human eyes and the brain’s memory.” * * * Facial recognition cameras are becoming more common across China: Among the awarded bid notices ChinaFile analyzed, only one used the phrase “human face” in 2009, when the technology was much less mature, compared with about 350 such notices in 2018 and 470 in 2019. The cameras work in tandem with massive databases of facial images, employing increasingly sophisticated algorithms to match a newly-captured facial image with one already in the database. Police don’t only want such camera systems to link passers-by to existing dossiers, they also want them to be able to use machine learning to spot disguises. In Guangxi’s Luchuan county, for example, the Public Security Bureau sought a facial recognition algorithm that could detect “disguising behaviors, such as wearing hats, masks, glasses, sunglasses, wigs, and fake moustaches.” Yet, facial recognition capabilities, while rolling out to ever more localities, are not omnipresent. Local governments around China are still purchasing fewer cameras designed specifically for facial recognition than other types of cameras. (In practice, any camera can be used with facial recognition and other such software provided it produces images of sufficiently high resolution.) In Xiqiao, the 300 new facial recognition cameras purchased in 2019 sit atop a larger network of cameras, more than 1,100 of which were commissioned between 2006 and 2018. Often, local governments position comparatively costly facial recognition cameras where they believe they can harvest the most valuable data, or where they fear trouble could arise. For instance, when Chongxin county in Gansu province sought nearly 400 new cameras in 2019, only five were explicitly listed as compatible with facial recognition technology, three of which were designated for the bus station and two for the local temple, which is a tourist draw. Beyond facial recognition, the logic of grid management also shapes what additional capabilities local authorities want their surveillance systems to possess. This means paying special attention to people who are not from the area. Dozens of procurement notices, for example, specifically required camera systems that could automatically detect a car entering a city (or county, or town) for the first time. In Shishan township, about 15 miles north of Xiqiao, the Comprehensive Management, Petitioning, and Stability Maintenance Office in 2019 sought a camera system that could recognize and record non-local license plates, explaining that “in some cases vehicles entering the city for the first time are relatively suspicious” because “suspects flee crimes and use fake license plates, or sets of fake license plates.” Even back in 2016, officials in one district of Shandong province’s Jinan city sought a system that would identify vehicles entering the jurisdiction for the first time and automatically send a “warning text” to public security officers. Similarly, notices from some local governments called for systems that could produce automated risk assessments of the people they caught on camera, based on whether a person made a “first entry” into a particular area, appeared in a “high-risk zone,” or “only entered but did not exit,” among other criteria. Two different counties in Gansu, using identical language, detailed a system that would register such potentially threatening behaviors and calculate daily point scores for every individual it captured. This special attention to outsiders also appears throughout procurement notices for tools to “manage” the “floating population.” This term was formerly used mainly to refer to poorer, rural migrant laborers who move to cities seeking work. Due to the vagaries of China’s restrictive, decades-old household registration system, it’s often now applied to a much more diverse subsection of the population: people who simply don’t live in the place where they were born. Notices from around the country mention the need for surveillance technology to keep tabs on this group of citizens. In 2016, the Floating Population Management Office of Longjiang, yet another township in Foshan, sought mobile ID-card readers and scanning equipment to “strengthen the digitization of floating population management, improve the efficiency of grassroots floating population and rental housing coordination, [and] improve the registration rate of the floating population and the accuracy of information collected.” This equipment would interact with the city’s “Floating Population Management Comprehensive Information System Platform,” a type of database that exists in localities throughout the country aimed at keeping accurate records of where members of the floating population reside.

The focus on outsiders underscores a broader truth about surveillance in China: Local authorities maintain an elastic definition of what constitutes a threat, coupled with a paternalistic need to know about all the goings-on in their neighborhoods. In 2019, Party officials in one city district in Guangxi “focused on the service and management of the following three types of people: 1. Key populations such as those released from prison, those in community corrections, and drug users; 2. Individuals needing special care, such as the elderly, the disabled, veterans and their families, and families receiving welfare; 3. Women of childbearing age.” The same year, the Politics and Law Commission of one Gansu city sought to understand “the current situation of social governance” in part by conducting “multi-dimensional statistical analysis” on “key persons (such as those released from prison, community corrections, people with serious mental disorders caused by accidents and disasters, key youths, drug addicts, key persons who petition, key persons who threaten social stability, special groups of people, etc.).” Who exactly are “key persons” and “key populations”? These phrases refer to “would-be protesters and would-be dissidents” that the regime would “like to round up, or at least monitor,” political surveillance expert Jennifer Pan writes in Welfare for Autocrats: How Social Assistance in China Cares for its Rulers. Such people “are suspected of being likely to damage political, social, and economic stability in the future. These individuals are placed under intense surveillance, and all resources available to the regime are brought to bear to control their behavior.” Authorities repeatedly demonstrate a desire to automatically identify and track such individuals: A number of procurement notices seeking facial recognition cameras stipulated that such cameras be able to interact with existing police blacklists in real time. The system sought by police in Luchuan county in Guangxi, for example, would allow for the input of up to five different blacklists, producing different types of alarms for each when it detected a match with a live video feed. Such a setup would enable officials to prioritize and differentiate between targets rather than having to work from a single blacklist. A system that the Politics and Law Commission of the local Communist Party in the Xiaoshan district of the city of Hangzhou purchased in July 2019 allows for up to 999 different blacklists, each with discrete settings. According to the notice, “Each [blacklist] library should be managed separately, and have its own alarm thresholds.” These surveillance systems are not only aimed at people already under government scrutiny. They are also there to stop ordinary citizens from “crossing jurisdictions to band together, stirring up trouble, and assembling illegally,” or to identify individuals previously off the government radar. Why, exactly, might the state’s collection of this information be alarming? “If you’re aware data is being collected and monitored by the government, over time you internalize fear, which will guide your behavior,” says Xiao Qiang, a researcher focused on technology and human rights at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information. “How many Chinese people don’t want to say something on WeChat because they know it will be collected and used against them? They self-censor themselves. . . You know the government can get you at any time. That fear is real in China. Once you have that fear—when there’s cameras all over the place—it instills that fear in you to get you to control your own behavior.” * * * The Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, in northwest China, is the site of some of the most pervasive and invasive surveillance systems in the world, designed to distinguish between ethnic groups and to target the region’s ethnic minority population. While officials in Xiqiao may seem obsessed with residents’ daily activities, their zeal pales in comparison to Xinjiang surveillance officials’ fixation on Uighurs and other ethnic minority Muslim citizens. A person’s facial hair, family size, even a person’s name: all are traits local governments in Xinjiang have viewed as signs of danger. In the name of mitigating such “threats,” the government has interned Uighurs on a massive scale, forcibly cut their birth rates, and pressed them into labor in factories. The sometimes fantastical-sounding surveillance tactics in Xinjiang—QR codes on people’s front doors, which police can scan for information about the household; requiring residents to swipe ID cards to fuel up their cars—can make it seem a place apart, defying comparison to other areas of China. Indeed, the checkpoints that blanket the region don’t currently appear elsewhere in China. And the small monitoring outposts authorities call “convenience police stations,” as though they are there to benefit local residents, only show up in Xinjiang and Tibet. But while Xinjiang may be the most well-reported, and most extreme, locale for state surveillance in China, it is not sui generis. Procurement notices from Xinjiang frequently make reference to the same nationwide surveillance programs, such as Safe Cities, Smart Cities, and Sharp Eyes, that serve as the basis for surveillance projects elsewhere. Many of the mechanisms and measures the regional government has taken in Xinjiang have direct analogues in other provinces. The crucial difference between Xinjiang and other areas of the PRC is who is being targeted. Instead of focusing solely on a particular group of non-residents, potential dissidents, or possible criminals, authorities target all members of particular ethnic and religious groups. Ethnic minority Muslims, many of them Uighurs, are the primary objects of surveillance in Xinjiang; their relatively high share of the population means that more people are acutely aware they are being watched, and the watching is that much more visible. The means of surveillance, however, are largely the same as elsewhere in China.     10.30.20      Budgeting for Surveillance        The work of buying and building out surveillance infrastructure in China largely falls to local governments. Numerous localities and agencies make purchases as they implement a range of centrally-mandated surveillance projects and campaigns. Given...      About 150 miles from China’s border with Kazakhstan, as the crow flies, lies Shawan county, which touts itself as the home of the nationally-renowned dish dapanji, or “big-plate chicken.” Shawan (or Savan) county is sparsely populated; it holds a little more than 200,000 people, spread over an area somewhat smaller than the state of Connecticut. Nearly two-thirds of residents are ethnic Han, the majority throughout China. 18 percent are ethnic Kazakh. 5 percent are ethnic Uighur. This population breakdown is common in northern Xinjiang, where the proportion of ethnic minorities is far smaller than it is in the south. Yet, even in this majority-Han county, the perceived threat from non-Han residents consumes the attention of local authorities. “An Analysis of Social Issues and Government Objectives,” a 200-page surveillance feasibility study presented as part of a 2017 Shawan government procurement notice, speaks darkly of “Western hostile forces” who have This sort of language is specific to Xinjiang and reflects the government’s view that ethnic minority Muslims are inherently vulnerable to the siren song of international, religiously-fueled terrorism. The government’s own repressive policies in the region do not generally factor into its analysis of interethnic animus. Thus, Shawan officials sought computer systems that would “automatically identify and investigate key persons involved in terrorism and [threatening social] stability.” To make strategic use of the 70 facial recognition cameras recommended in the document, 50 of them would be placed in mosques. At the time of the feasibility study, Shawan possessed a total of 484 cameras, feeding into various separate monitoring and control systems. The study declared this insufficient to meet video surveillance requirements posed by the central government in a May 2015 policy missive. The study also faulted residential compounds, shops, and even other local government agencies for failing to appreciate the importance of video surveillance and for not having installed enough equipment. This had left police with inadequate options, if they wanted to make use of cameras other than their own. To address these deficiencies, the study outlined a more comprehensive surveillance system. On the front end: 4,791 networked HD cameras, 70 of which were to be facial recognition units, would be positioned in crowded places with clear entrances and exits, including mosques, with others to be installed in train stations and bus stations. On the back end: a set of interlocking platforms would span three administrative levels (the village/township level, the county level, and the prefectural level) and three network layers (the public Internet, a private video network, and the Public Security Bureau’s own intranet). Critically, the system would allow for information to flow from private cameras to the police via a “societal resource integration platform” that drew from surveillance in “hotels, Internet cafes, gas stations, schools, hospital monitoring [sic], bicycle rental points, and shops along the street, etc.” Such systems are not unique to Xinjiang. Procurement notices from Shandong, Fujian, Heilongjiang, and Shanxi provinces, as well as Beijing, all mentioned the need for this type of platform in their jurisdictions.      Features 12.30.20      ‘Because There Were Cameras, I Didn’t Ask Any Questions’  Darren Byler         Sometime in the summer of 2019, Vera Zhou, a young college student from the University of Washington, forgot to pretend that she was from the non-Muslim majority group in China, the Han. At a checkpoint at the mall, she put her ID on the scanner and...      Similarly, Shawan authorities’ efforts to formulate an orderly surveillance scheme parallel such endeavors elsewhere. Local governments throughout China seek to dissect physical space and human interaction into controllable units. In Xiqiao, this manifested as a focus on basic human needs, and on a taxonomy of highly-trafficked public areas. In Shawan—as in Fujian, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu—the emphasis was on geography, breaking the county down into geometric components based on natural or man-made features. According to the feasibility study, Shawan would divide its video control system into five units: circles, blocks, grids, lines, and spots. Circles, the largest units of control, would include inter-provincial, inter-city, or inter-county checkpoints, depending on their size. All entry and exit points within a circle would need to be controlled: “Through the monitoring of all passages into and out of counties and townships, as well as highway entrances, airports, railway stations, passenger stations, and water transport terminals, a closed, big ‘circle’ is formed.” Blocks, the next largest units, were either an existing administrative subdivision or an area of land bordered by rivers, mountains, tunnels, and other such features allowing them to be easily sealed off. These were followed by grids (like those in the grid management system), which in turn contained even smaller subdivisions, forming a “net.” Lines were national or provincial highways crossing a township, to be equipped with camera checkpoints every 3 kilometers inside “main” urban areas, every 5 kilometers in all other urban areas, and every 15 kilometers elsewhere. Finally, spots were semi-enclosed spaces near important buildings (like government offices or military outposts), spaces where people tend to gather, and other areas with “complicated security” or where “incidents” were believed likely to occur. In order to meet the varying demands of each location, public security authorities, in Shawan and elsewhere, procure a wide variety of cameras. Officials might seek to purchase panoramic cameras, high-altitude cameras, traffic cameras, as well as cameras enabled with software allowing them to monitor population density or sound an alarm when they detect “anomalies” or behavior considered suspicious. The sheer volume of government-run cameras in China has no parallel. “You hear people saying London is just like Beijing,” says Charles Rollet, a reporter with IPVM, a website that reports on and tests video surveillance systems. “No, no, no. Compared to China, the number of cameras is much lower.” In addition, some aspects of these systems—such as the societal resource integration platforms, which automatically funnel private video surveillance feeds directly to the government—are under far more direct government control than in other countries. “It is very centralized, very top-down, police-driven, law enforcement-driven,” says Rollet. “In France or the U.S., the number of cameras is lower and they are less coordinated. In the U.S., some [cameras] are hooked up directly to the police, but mostly police rely on private cameras to get surveillance footage after the event.” A diagram of camera types and surveillance system networking, from a 2019 procurement notice issued by the Shishan township Comprehensive Management, Petitioning, and Stability Maintenance Office in Guangdong province. No matter how vast the number, all these cameras can only provide visual (and sometimes auditory) information. Shawan authorities hoped to gather even more data through WiFi sniffers, a technology in use elsewhere in China as well. In December 2019, The New York Times reported that governments in Henan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces used similar technology to obtain phone data from people walking by, and, in some cases, were able to match that data with images supplied by nearby facial recognition cameras. Indeed, this practice appears widespread. Procurement notices from Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Fujian, Beijing, and elsewhere also sought WiFi sniffers. Authorities often present this type of equipment as part of an integrated surveillance system that can amalgamate data from multiple sources. WiFi sniffers (sometimes installed near or just below surveillance cameras) work by intercepting unique, identifying information about an individual phone. This can be part or all of an individual’s mobile phone number, or other data that can tie the phone to the person who owns it (such as the phone’s media access control (MAC) address, service set identifier (SSID), international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), or international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI)). Depending on the locality, authorities’ surveillance algorithms can then potentially match up this information to camera footage. But it is possible that sniffers can dig even deeper into a person’s online history. Local authorities in Fujian, Guangxi, and Guangdong hoped to use the data intercepted by WiFi sniffers to ascertain an individual’s “virtual identities.” The Fujian procurement notice spells out exactly what this vague wording means: users’ account information on popular websites and social media platforms like QQ, WeChat, and Taobao. This capability may seem far-fetched, but in the China context, where many web browsers and apps employ weak or nonexistent encryption, it is technologically feasible, at least on certain types of phones that don’t have robust security protections built in. Similarly, the Guangxi and Guangdong authorities wanted their sniffers to be able to access a users’ browsing history. As elsewhere in China, Shawan’s facial recognition systems are meant to interact with police blacklists. Shawan’s classification of blacklisted people reflects not only the regional focus on terrorism, but also officials’ penchant for applying the terms “terrorism” or “extremism” to a wide range of human behavior. The Shawan feasibility study includes “people with a history of terrorism” as one of the types of “key people” it wants to track, along with people who have a history of drug use, theft, or gambling. It also enumerates other particular targets of surveillance: “high risk people” (“national-level fugitives, individuals with substantial criminal records, and mentally ill troublemakers”) and “sensitive people” (“people from ‘special’ areas, people employed in ‘special’ jobs,” and “the long-term unemployed”).     10.30.20      Cameras and Software        To reach their goal of monitoring all of China’s key public spaces, local authorities need to buy a lot of cameras and other technology. The approximately 76,000 surveillance-related procurement notices ChinaFile analyzed offer a glimpse into the...      Though Xinjiang officials’ focus on what they describe as religiously-fueled “terrorism” contrasts in important ways from police interests further east, some of these security preoccupations exist elsewhere in China. On the other side of the country, in the city of Harbin, public security authorities sought AI algorithms that could ferret out would-be terrorists. Local officials in Gansu and Chongqing and the country’s railway police have sought facial recognition systems to determine a person’s ethnicity. In Guangxi and Beijing, multiple procurement notices requested that such systems be able to tell if a person were Uighur. One county in Fujian province specifically noted it wanted to monitor places where Uighurs lived. A Human Rights Watch report on Xinjiang’s mass surveillance system, the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, notes that the system can alert police when it detects that a driver is not the one to whom a car is registered. This type of matching happens elsewhere in China as well. One county in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region wanted its traffic camera system to be able to capture and save an image of a driver’s face separately from the image of the car (presumably with a note that the person is linked to the car). In Liaoning province, Beipiao city sought cameras with a “hybrid capture mode,” which allows them to simultaneously track pedestrians, non-motor vehicles, and motor vehicles and “connect human faces with bodies, license plates, and vehicles.” What implications do these capabilities have for average citizens—people who, as far as they know, aren’t under any particular government scrutiny? “Usually the argument in support of some of this technology is, ‘Well, if you’ve done nothing wrong, why are you afraid of that security camera?’” says Berkeley’s Xiao Qiang. Adds Xiao, “They are forming a digital model of you that becomes the basis of ‘algorithmic governance’. . . If you behave well according to this data, then the government gives you a reward—you’re in the upper class of citizens. If you perform badly in the government’s eye, then you’re in all kinds of trouble. Your life changes, your fate is defined by your digital persona.” Unlike in other parts of China, surveillance pervades daily life in Xinjiang. Surveillance there is so aggressive that even residents not being targeted feel its pressure. “In other parts of China, surveillance is more seamless and less noticeable because the targeted population is so much smaller,” says Darren Byler, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Colorado at Boulder researching the dispossession of Uighurs through surveillance. “The people being targeted know about it, for sure. Others either don’t know, or it makes them feel secure. But in Xinjiang, people are really freaked out by the technology, because they’re already really sensitive about saying something wrong—especially ethnic minorities, but also Han.” The pervasive fear among much of the population, and the opacity of the state, heighten residents’ anxiety about what surveillance technology is capable of: “Rumors extend the reach of the surveillance system and make people think it’s better than it really is.” (ChinaFile only collected a small number of notices from Xinjiang. Given the extensive documentation of surveillance in the region, some of which has relied on procurement documents, it’s likely government officials have removed some surveillance-related procurement notices from the Chinese Government Procurement Network website, or did not post notices on the site in the first place.) Xinjiang’s authorities apply many of the same technologies and conceptual frameworks as are in use throughout the country.   The two other ways in which surveillance in Xinjiang differs most drastically from the rest of China are the omnipresent “convenience police stations” and physical security checkpoints that dot towns, villages, and cities throughout the region. “They don’t exist in any other places in China,” says Byler, “at least not to the same extent.” These checkpoints are constantly providing Xinjiang’s surveillance algorithms with additional photographic fodder. In Shawan, where people have to provide their ID number and have their picture taken in order to enter subways, hotels, Internet cafes, and other such places, authorities hoped to use this information to train an integrated tracking system. Xinjiang may not be a harbinger of surveillance regimes elsewhere in China, simply because, thus far, the government has not deemed other regional populations deserving of such intense scrutiny. Yet, Xinjiang’s authorities apply many of the same technologies and conceptual frameworks as are in use throughout the country. Across China, local officials are rolling out their own circles, blocks, grids, cameras, sniffers, and scanners, ever alert for signs of trouble and doggedly pursuing the surveillance tools that will give them the control they crave. * * * Local authorities across China don’t simply stamp out cookie-cutter surveillance infrastructure copied from their neighbors. Some are building systems that push current technological limits, like those offering “predictive policing” software. Though local surveillance initiatives flow from the same central-level plans, their integration remains limited. At this point in time, no single database contains all the country’s surveillance data. Even the most sophisticated tracking systems may go blind as a surveillance target steps across a county line. Local governments construct their systems separately, contracting out one by one to meet centrally-mandated goals. In practice, this offers wide latitude for local officials to decide which technologies, from the commonplace to the futuristic, to install in their hometowns.     10.30.20      The Surveillance Bureaucracy        The Chinese government’s surveillance capabilities, while vast and impressive, do not result from one monolithic project. Rather, various central and local government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) entities have participated in a series of...      In 2017, officials in the northeastern Chinese city of Harbin hoped to buy a system that would peer more deeply into residents’ lives, in line with the directives of the Skynet campaign. A procurement notice posted by the Xiangfang district Public Security Bureau outlined the “modules” it hoped would enable more granular tracking of targeted individuals. The key person control module would conduct a “multi-dimensional analysis” using a person’s mobile phone information, railway ticket purchases, and hotel stays, among other information. The fund analysis module would look at bank card numbers and transaction data to reconstruct an individual’s international “financial transaction relationship.” The orbit analysis module would employ geographic information systems technology to display a target’s daily travels. This would allow “researchers to analyze the key person’s activity patterns from a regional perspective, so as to spot any abnormalities and intervene in advance.” A multivariate analysis module would draw connections between and among multiple individuals, multiple vehicles, or multiple cases. People who had stayed at the same hotel, used the same Internet cafe, or taken the same plane could be linked together, feeding back into algorithms searching for patterns between drivers and cars, or case files and names. Finally, a terrorist and violent person prediction module would take existing case files involving “terrorism and violence” and use them to train police computers to “classify and make predictions about all people, to identify key persons with the potential to get involved in terrorism, bombings, and so on.” This module, as described, is a version of predictive policing—a concept roundly criticized by human rights and civil liberties advocates in countries that have used it. A 2016 report by the American Civil Liberties Union described how predictive policing models often rely on data, such as crime reports, that are biased: As a result, says AI and human rights law expert Daragh Murray, “a lot of predictive policing algorithms produce discriminatory outputs.” They also undercut a fundamental commitment to respecting individual decision-making and “treating people as people. Predictive policing models by their nature conflict with that, because in simplistic terms, they’re based on a stereotype.” Moreover, citizens’ uncertainty about what factors might cause a predictive policing model to target them has a “chilling effect” on their behavior. Uighurs, whose very ethnicity has been deemed a threat in such models, “are a good example of a really chilled population.” No single database contains all the country’s surveillance data. Even the most sophisticated tracking systems may go blind as a surveillance target steps across a county line.   These ambitious, cutting-edge technologies might call to mind the science fiction thriller Minority Report, where police harness “pre-cognitive” individuals’ psychic abilities to arrest people before they commit crimes. Still, procurement notices reflect local authorities’ wishlists, not necessarily what they actually get. Companies vying for government contracts, says surveillance expert Albert Fox Cahn, likely overstate claims about their products’ “accuracy, predictive capacity, AI, and computer vision.” Moreover, even the most ambitious officials must contend with the realities of governance in China. The surveillance “system,” if it can even be called a “system,” remains highly fragmented. A striking number of different local governments and Party offices (sometimes with overlapping jurisdictions) purchase surveillance equipment: Out of roughly 22,000 awarded bid notices for surveillance-related equipment, more than 8,500 unique state and Party agencies appeared as purchasers, spread across the town, district, county, provincial, and even national levels. The majority of these were local Public Security Bureaus, and about 10 percent were Party organizations, like the office in Xiqiao building the “portrait perception network.”      The bureaucratic groupings here derive from the names of government entities listed as purchasers for awarded bid notices.   The bureaucratic groupings here derive from the names of government entities listed as purchasers for awarded bid notices. Each locale contends with a slightly different set of perceived needs and threats. Officials in Xinjiang may be animated by fear of ethnic minority populations; other governments may be responding to outbreaks of crime. Officials in Hebei province’s Raoyang county, according to awarded bid notices, have spent more than 191 million renminbi on surveillance-related purchases in recent years, apparently as part of an effort to quash a local oil- and gas-stealing gang. Localities also must decide how to respond to mandates from above, which often arrive in successive campaign-style rollouts. From Safe Cities, launched in 2003, to Skynet in 2005, to Smart Cities in 2012, and, finally, through Sharp Eyes, which began in 2015, local governments throughout China have installed or upgraded their surveillance arsenals as these mandates washed across the country. Each of these campaigns has had a slightly different focus and reached different parts of the country at different times. The unevenness and disaggregation of local surveillance systems hasn’t escaped the country’s leaders. The central government’s 2015 policy prescription for video surveillance listed “increasingly prominent” problems such as “imperfect laws and regulations, inadequate overall planning, unstandardized networking and sharing, and incomplete management mechanisms,” all of which had “severely restricted the construction and development of a three-dimensional prevention and control system for social order.” Thus, the policy document made an explicit goal of integrating disparate camera networks, calling for “the video surveillance networking rate to reach 100 percent in key public areas,” and for “network interconnection, platform interoperability, and gradually linking up with grassroots comprehensive service management platforms in order to maximize networked sharing of video image resources from public spaces.” Officials around the country have taken up the call: The number of awarded bid notices referencing “video sharing,” “shared platform,” “shared applications,” and similar terms have increased year on year through the end of 2019. Different ministries and localities manage their own databases of citizen information, including both video and non-video data, which are not necessarily linked together. Numerous databases can exist even within one bureaucracy. Under the purview of the Ministry of Public Security and its branches, for example, are the Comprehensive Management Platform, the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, the Safe Borders Platform, the Population Information System, the Fugitive System, and the Floating Population Information System, among others. Integration can occur horizontally (across bureaucracies and geographical regions) or vertically (within the same bureaucracy but up and down the hierarchy); notices expressed interest in improving one or both. Last year in Beijing, authorities sought to complete a city-wide Sharp Eyes Video Sharing and Exchange Platform. The platform would integrate video footage from cameras controlled by different government departments into a single system, allowing users to access more footage and to re-use data for their own purposes. The platform specs called for accommodating footage from some 200,000 cameras, with the possibility to expand up to one million. Footage would need to be stored for a minimum of 30 days, with some stored up to 90 days. As of last year, Foshan’s Shishan township was working to create an interface to give users access to multiple databases through a single log-in. In Gansu, police wanted to ensure that officers at the provincial, city, and county levels could all access the same information.

Translation by ChinaFile. Video surveillance integration efforts echo more general initiatives to link up information streams from various police databases. In 2017, a Human Rights Watch report described the “Police Cloud” system, designed to aggregate data about citizens into provincial-level “clouds.” References to “police clouds” also appear in more recent procurement notices. “We documented the purchase of equipment,” says Maya Wang, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, “but we have much less knowledge of whether or not the integration has happened. Things are fragmented along regional and provincial lines. At the same time, there is still a kind of general framework and philosophy, and a drive for greater standardization.” This push toward standardization is manifest in references to protocols to be adhered to, for instance in networking video surveillance systems or alarms, that appear in procurement notices from around the country. Gaps in the overall surveillance system—between bureaucracies, between superior and subordinate offices, between projects, and between technologies—mean that the Chinese government does not have a seamless dragnet to ensnare any individual target. But it is working to patch holes that let information slip through. Samantha Hoffman, a senior analyst in the Cyber Centre at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, cautions against assuming that the current, fragmented system is simply “all chaos. Yeah, there’s a bit of chaos, but there’s also a lot of standardization.” She adds, Just as important as looking at the government side, she says, is to “look at how tech companies are interacting with each other—you see a lot more cohesion. There are industry alliances to standardize technology development.” * * * The procurement documents ChinaFile analyzed cannot, in and of themselves, offer a complete account of what is currently happening on the ground in China. But as a statement of surveillance ambition, their message is clear. “Over the long term, that’s what makes it concerning,” says IPVM’s Charles Rollet. Media coverage that portrays China in 2020 as an Orwellian surveillance state “is inaccurate and silly, but it could be reality down the line.” What would such a reality mean for day-to-day life in China? Would there be any semblance of privacy left—the sort of going-about-one’s-business, blend-into-the-crowd privacy that many of us implicitly expect in public spaces—to people living in the PRC? What does it portend for public spaces beyond China’s borders? A number of democracies are already struggling with the implications of these technologies, which often pit a desire for public security against an expectation of privacy and consent. What happens as China normalizes, or sells, these technologies to places where public debate about them is quashed before it can occur? Will PRC surveillance tech strengthen the wave of authoritarian governance that seems to be rolling across the globe? Despite the more visible reminders of state surveillance, many Chinese citizens simply don’t realize the extent to which they can be watched. Certainly, it is hard for passers-by to miss the thickets of surveillance cameras spread across the country, garlanded over roadways and encrusting buildings. Officials might not shy away from reminding people they are being watched, particularly if it keeps them on their best behavior, yet there remains a clear impulse to conceal aspects of the system. A number of procurement notices ChinaFile reviewed specifically sought the ability to collect and preserve information “without disrupting people’s daily life and work,” or to control equipment remotely “to enhance the concealment of use.” Still, the relative inconspicuousness of surveillance in eastern China may now be eroding. As the country emerges from quarantine measures imposed to combat the spread of COVID-19, local governments are imposing digital checkpoints and location-tracking to determine where residents are allowed to go. The system does not just passively collect information. It requires people to actively participate, scanning QR codes with their smartphones to ride in taxis or visit restaurants, banks, and other public places. Some people have reported that officials installed cameras outside their apartments, or even inside their homes. COVID-19-related monitoring layers on top of the existing surveillance system, drawing on infrastructure and knowledge acquired during the last five years as the PRC increased its baseline surveillance capabilities. Whether they are assessing residents’ basic needs or trying to predict future behavior, officials engaged in surveillance are pursuing a single goal: to keep China’s citizens under near-constant watch. And, even if the system never reaches the intended apogee, its designers don’t require every available cutting-edge predictive technology for their system to work. The Chinese government already possesses, after all, perhaps the most agile, invasive, and omnipresent surveillance capabilities in the world. In February, authorities tracked down and detained Xu Zhiyong, a renowned civil rights advocate and lawyer, who had been in hiding for nearly two months and had refrained from using a cell phone in order to prevent being tracked. He did, however, sometimes go outside to exercise and to have meals. Did facial recognition technology play a role in his capture? According to Human Rights Watch’s Maya Wang, finding definitive evidence that someone was apprehended specifically because of these digital surveillance systems is “like trying to find a needle in the sea.” With the exception of Xinjiang, where omnipresent checkpoints and police stations serve as a constant reminder that the state is observing the population, “it’s not easy to find someone who knows they were victimized by these systems. People don’t know how they’re being watched.” Iris Zhang and Shen Lu provided research for this article.

How does the outlook help China strengthen national security against the background of increasingly complex domestic and external challenges? And how should one view the recent developments related to national security? Tao Jian, former president of the University of International Relations shares his views on the issue with China Daily’s Zhu Ping. Excerpts follow: Question 1: In the 10 years since it was proposed, what have been the most important achievements of the national security outlook compared with the traditional national security outlook? A 1: According to China’s National Security Law, national security means the State not facing any danger or threat internally or externally to its sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity, or the welfare of the people, sustainable socioeconomic development, or the capability to maintain security. The overall national security outlook has developed in the new era. On April 15, 2014, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, proposed the “overall national security outlook” at the first meeting of the Central National Security Commission of the CPC, pointed out the necessity to adhere to the overall national security outlook, treat the people as the purpose, political security as fundamental, economic security as the cornerstone, military, cultural and social security as the guarantee, and the promotion of international security, to embark on a national security path with Chinese characteristics. This exposition established the “five-in-one” framework of the overall national security outlook. In the decade since the proposal, the overall national security outlook has expanded to cover as many as 20 areas — political, military, territorial, economic, financial, cultural, social, technological, cyber, food, ecological, resources, nuclear, overseas interests, space, deep sea, polar regions, biological, artificial intelligence, and data security — embodying the concept of “comprehensive security”. However, not all the problems the 20 sectors face should be classified as national security threats until they reach a significant scale. For example, an individual telephone scam does not represent a national security problem. But the more than 437,000 tele scams cracked down nationwide in 2023 do present a challenge to national security. Also, equal efforts are not needed to deal with each of the problems faced by the 20 sectors. Yet it would be wrong to deal with national security issues in a particular sector and ignore the others. In light of the unprecedented complexity and challenges, the achievements of the outlook have been threefold. First, China has safeguarded national security and maintained political stability, as well as advanced scientific development and helped intertwined high-quality development with high-level security. Second, the overall nature of the outlook surpasses traditional security concept and thinking. It is tailored to China’s real conditions. Over the past decade, China has been facing an unprecedented challenging external environment due to some Western countries’ China-containment policy. On the domestic front, China’s main contradiction, that is, the contradiction between people’s increasing aspiration for a better life and the unbalanced and inadequate development is evident in income disparities, urban-rural gaps, regional differences and the levels of productivity in different sectors and regions. In this context, the national security outlook addresses a series of major issues. And third, the outlook highlights the idea of putting people’s security first. It makes clear that security is an important part of the people’s aspiration for a better life. Q2: How do you evaluate China’s national security situation now? What are the biggest challenges facing China? A2: China’s national security situation is undergoing significant changes. From an international perspective, China’s current external environment is “extremely complex”. China’s economic and technological development and international competitive environment are undergoing drastic changes, with major power competition becoming even more severe. The current state and future direction of China-US relations are key variables affecting China’s external security environment. Beijing’s main geopolitical risks lie across the Taiwan Strait, as well as with the common challenges of climate change and international financing, which could pose a threat to the country’s security. Besides, the political and security situations of small and medium-sized countries involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts require close attention. And the threat of terrorism remains a security issue that China needs to take into serious consideration, as the recent terrorist attacks on the outskirts of Moscow and on Chinese personnel in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan have once again reminded us. In other words, global economic recovery is weak, geopolitical conflicts are intensifying, and protectionism and unilateralism rising, slowing China’s growth rate. It is an arduous task, in such a situation, to simultaneously implement reform, advance development and maintain stability. Boosting economic recovery and development in itself is a tough job, especially at a time when deep-seated contradictions accumulated over the long term are becoming more complex. In addition, following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the technological and financial war (the freezing of $300 billion of assets of the Central Bank of Russia by the United States and the European Union), and the food, energy and cyber information war waged by the US and other Western economies against Russia have sent a warning to China to prepare for extreme scenarios. China should therefore strengthen its national security work in key areas such as political security, territorial security, economic security, social security, cybersecurity and external security. There is also a need for China to expedite the construction of a new development pattern to boost its economic resilience, competitiveness and development capability in the face of foreseeable and unforeseeable storms. Q3: Some foreign media reports claim the recent enactment of the Safeguarding National Security Bill will stifle Hong Kong’s vitality. What is your opinion on the issue? A3: The passage of the Safeguarding National Security Bill in the Hong Kong Legislative Council on March 19 fulfills the constitutional responsibility and historic mission of enacting a law based on Article 23 of the Basic Law 26 years after Hong Kong’s return to the motherland. Fortifying the “protective wall” for the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong, the law is a big milestone in the development of “one country, two systems” in the new era. Neglecting security in the pursuit of economic development carries hidden risks. If the foundation of security is not solid, the edifice of development will be shaky. As a special administrative region of China, Hong Kong witnessed rampant violent demonstrations in 2019, leading to the withering of various industries, making it impossible to guarantee even the basic livelihood of the people, let alone boosting economic development. The bill will help balance the maintenance of national security with the protection of rights, freedoms and economic development, enable Hong Kong to better leverage its status as a global logistics and financial hub to integrate with the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and deepen its open and close exchanges and cooperation with various countries and regions. The implementation of the bill will not impact normal business activities and international exchanges and cooperation. But it will no longer allow foreign forces that have used Hong Kong as both a financial paradise and a bridgehead for anti-China and anti-communist activists to continue with their activities. The bill, however, will make real foreign investors more confident to invest in Hong Kong. Q4: Many security issues are now intertwined, coupled with rapid technological developments. How should China improve security governance with emerging challenges addressed? A4: China needs to strengthen national security coordination, improve the legal, policy, risk-monitoring and early-warning systems, as well as the national emergency management system for national security, and improve the security guarantee in areas such as the economy, major infrastructure, financing, data, resources, nuclear, outer space and oceans. It also needs to improve the layout of national security forces, and build a comprehensive, efficient national security protection system. In the new era, the national security policy should address not only common security issues in the field of development but also special security issues during the process of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. That some Western powers are trying to sow discord between the Chinese government and the people is not new. They have been trying to do so for decades using various mediums including the radio, television, newspapers and books to feed the Chinese people, especially the younger generation, with anti-Party and Anti-government rhetoric. The Western powers have now shifted their focus to online media, which proves that “political security is the foundation of national security”. Political security determines the state of security in fields such as economic security, military security and social security. Without political security, security cannot be guaranteed in other fields. In fact, security issues in other fields will reflect the strength of political security. Therefore, it is necessary to promote national security with the ultimate goal of strengthening political security, making the maintenance of political security the primary task in responding to security risks and challenges in various fields, and fully leveraging its role as a fulcrum of the mechanism coordinating security in various fields. Q5: Some foreign media reports claim the revised laws such as Counter-Espionage Law could accelerate the exodus of foreign enterprises from and decline in foreign investments in China. Are such reports misleading? A5: Espionage poses a big threat to national security and undermines the interests of a country. It is an internationally recognized practice of sovereign nations to enact legislation to prevent and combat espionage activities and safeguard national security. The United States’ Espionage Act of 1917, the National Security Act in the early days of the Cold War, the Homeland Security Act following the Sept 11, 2001, attacks, the Foreign Investment and National Security Act, the Enhanced Intelligence Act of 2002, and the periodic release of “counterintelligence strategies” all show the US’ efforts to better safeguard national security through legislation. In fact, China’s anti-espionage legislation lags behind that of Western countries. As such, China needs to strengthen the legal and operational systems to better safeguard national security. Intelligence agencies of dozens of countries have been conducting espionage activities against China. And the considerable number of espionage cases China’s national security agencies uncover every year represent only the “tip of the iceberg”. Espionage activities pose a significant threat to the China, as they target the core departments of the Party, the government and the military, as well as new fields such as biological and genetic information. In addition to traditional methods such as recruitment and subversion, espionage activities now include cyber theft and intelligence gathering. This is a crucial reason why China revised the Counter-Espionage Law last year. The Ministry of State Security has said on its official WeChat account that China’s anti-espionage legal framework is clear and transparent, and will not affect the legitimate operations, investments, work, studies and life of foreign enterprises and individuals in China. Addressing concerns about expanded enforcement powers under the Counter-Espionage Law, and foreign enterprises and individuals being subjected to “data collection” and “arbitrary detention”, the ministry made it clear that the law strictly limits the powers and processes involved in anti-espionage work. The law also regulates the conditions, procedures and scope for national security agencies to access data, and safeguards the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and organizations. To be sure, the espionage cases China pursues are generally solid and can withstand scrutiny, and national security agencies are disciplined and professional enough to enforce the law rigorously and effectively. The revised Counter-Espionage Law incorporates the principle of coordinated development and security into relevant articles. This principle is reflected throughout the entire law. By clearly defining the boundaries and red lines of security, the law better promotes development, and is conducive to creating an environment that is open and secure, as well as vibrant and orderly. China welcomes foreign enterprises to develop in the country as long as they operate in compliance with the law and have no ulterior motives. It is important to guard against foreign powers using the Counter-Espionage Law as a tool to undermine China’s business environment. Premier Li Qiang recently emphasized that China will continue to build a first-class business environment that is market-oriented, based on the rule of law, is internationalized and protects the legitimate rights and interests of all types of enterprises in accordance with the law. Q6: Why do some Western governments abuse the concept of national security? For example, the US administration has falsely accused China of using Chinese-made smartphones to steal user information, and claims that the cranes used in ports and electric vehicles pose a threat to US national security. Does this, by extension of the US’ logic, mean foreign products in China, too, pose a security risk? What are the dangers of the misuse of national security for economic and technological decoupling? A6: From Wikileaks to former US National Security Agency agent Edward Snowden, security-related incidents have long proved that the US spies on all countries — not only its adversaries but even on its staunchest allies. This time, the US administration’s accusations, inadvertently makes it clear that it intends to showcase its capability to control everything, from Boeing aircraft to computer systems to smartphones, which serves as a forceful warning to countries using US products and services to increase vigilance and enhance precautions. The US’ politicization, weaponization and securitization of issues related to trade, technology and even personnel exchanges are driven by its strategic decision to view China as the “only competitor with the intention and capability to reshape the international order” and win the competition against China. For example, in the field of chips, perhaps the US knows that it is violating the market laws, and not only suppressing the rights and interests of Chinese enterprises but also disrupting the semiconductor ecosystem, thereby harming its own interests. The US’ obsession with “harming others without benefiting itself” is evident especially in the field of technology, in which it frequently resorts to tricks, and gets entangled in the “broad securitization trap” it believes it has dug for others. In response to some Western countries’ efforts to “decouple” from the Chinese economy, China says it does not engage in broad securitization nor does it intend to close the door to the world; instead, it aims to further expand its opening-up. China’s position is clear: on the one hand, it is against hegemony of any kind; on the other hand, it attaches great importance to safeguarding national technological security and promoting new quality productive forces. China is pursuing high-quality development, which means it has taken technological innovation as the logical starting point for promoting development, cultivating talents advancing technologies, boosting the economy and strengthening national security. All of this will be reflected in the new quality productive forces that are driven by advanced technology in line with the new development concept.

The sensitivity and accuracy of the nation's surveillance network for novel contagious diseases, illnesses of unknown cause and key infectious diseases should also be improved significantly, it added. The document was released by the National Disease Control and Prevention Administration and eight other government departments. To achieve these goals, the document proposed a series of detailed measures, including connecting all grassroots medical institutions and private hospitals with the nation's infectious disease direct reporting system and strengthening monitoring of fever clinic visits and the number of severe cases and mortalities related to key infectious diseases. More efforts will also be made to establish a comprehensive laboratory network to test and monitor spread of pathogenic microorganisms, coordinate surveillance of different government departments and make use of information from the public and media reports. The document also stresses improving laboratory testing capabilities. Gradually, all provincial-level disease control centers should be equipped with a research lab on infectious diseases of biosafety level III â the second-highest level in a four-tier system. Municipal-level disease control facilities should be equipped with a lab of biosafety level II. Meanwhile, all municipal and county-level disease control facilities should be capable of carrying out nucleic acid tests, serological tests and rapid screening tests.

In a report released on Thursday, HRW said it had reverse engineered the app to see how mass surveillance worked. The app is used to closely monitor behaviours, it said, including lack of socialising, using too much electricity or having acquaintances abroad. Rights groups say Uighur Muslims are being severely persecuted in China. The UN has said there are credible reports up to a million Uighurs are being held in detention in Xinjiang, in what China says are ""re-education centres"". According to the rights group's report, the app is used by officials to record and file away information about people, external. In particular, it targets ""36 person types"" that authorities should pay attention to. These include people who seldom use their front door, use an abnormal amount of electricity and those that have gone on Hajj - an Islamic pilgrimage - without state authorisation.  The report does not make explicit mention of any ethnic groups specifically targeted, but the ""36 person types"" include ""unofficial"" imams - Islamic leaders - and those who follow Wahhabism, an Islamic doctrine.  The 36 person types listed in the HRW report The information taken from the app will be fed into the central system of the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) - the main system for mass surveillance in Xinjiang, says HRW.  HRW senior China researcher Maya Wang, external said IJOP was ""one of the world's most intrusive mass surveillance systems"". ""It gathers information from checkpoints on the street, gas stations, schools... pulls information from these facilities and monitors them for 'unusual' behaviour that triggers alerts [to the]authorities."" The app was obtained and analysed by HRW in partnership with Cure53, a Berlin-based security firm. This video can not be played In your face: China's all-seeing surveillance system As well as its Xinjiang operations, China has 170 million CCTV cameras in place across the country and by the end of 2020, an estimated 400 million new ones will be installed.  All this is part of China's aim to build what it calls ""the world's biggest camera surveillance network"". China's also setting up a ""social credit"" system that is meant to keep score of the conduct and public interactions of all its citizens.  The aim is that by 2020, everyone in China will be enrolled in a vast national database that compiles fiscal and government information, including minor traffic violations, and distils it into a single number - ranking each citizen. Xinjiang is a semi-autonomous region and in theory at least, has a degree of self-governance away from Beijing.  The Uighurs, a mostly Muslim ethnic minority, make up around 45% of its population.  HRW's report comes as China faces increasing scrutiny over its treatment of them and other minorities in Xinjiang. Up to one million Uighurs are being held in detention camps across Xinjiang, a UN human rights committee heard last year.  Uighurs make up around 45% of Xinjiang's population One member said she was concerned by reports that Beijing had ""turned the Uighur autonomous region into something that resembles a massive internment camp"". A BBC investigation last year revealed that what appear to be ""large prison-type structures"" have been built across Xinjiang in the past few years. China's hidden camps China Uighurs: All you need to know on Muslim 'crackdown' Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs?

Chinese,https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/notes-chinafile/whats-behind-chinas-laws-protect-privacy,2.7210516300963503,"Commuters look at their mobile phones as they ride a bus in Beijing, September 21, 2020, China. In his article “Authoritarian Privacy” for the University of Chicago Law Review, Mark Jia writes: “Privacy laws are traditionally associated with democracy. Yet autocracies increasingly have them.” In this ChinaFile Q&A, Jia and Samm Sacks engage in an exchange about what has motivated the Chinese government to enact and enforce a range of laws on information privacy and the implications for understanding the role of privacy laws in non-democratic states. Samm Sacks: Outside observers have commented that China appears to have a split identity when it comes to privacy: rules limit how firms handle citizens’ data, while the state has unchecked surveillance powers. Is this dichotomy accurate? What does privacy mean in China, particularly in the wake of COVID, when the scale and reach of government surveillance and the use of data-intensive technologies for tracking and monitoring appears to have intensified? Mark Jia: I agree with the view that China’s privacy laws are meant to preserve a broad “exceptional zone” for state surveillance in areas like intelligence collection, law enforcement, and domestic stability maintenance. I agree too that a lot of the rules and their enforcement have focused on how companies handle citizens’ data. For example, the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL for short), China’s first comprehensive privacy law enacted in 2021, establishes greater compliance obligations for major Internet platforms, such as a requirement to establish an independent body to “supervise” their privacy protection work. But I think the reality is more complex than a private-public dichotomy would suggest. Most notably, the PIPL explicitly applies to state organs. The aim is not just to discipline firms but also lower-level bureaucratic entities that are abusing or misusing citizens’ data. To take one somewhat mundane example, my article discusses a case in which a local prosecutor discovers that a county-level agricultural bureau has been disclosing information on machinery purchase subsidies online without removing the personal information of over 1,000 farmers. The local procuratorate (prosecutor’s office) initiated a procedure that essentially asked the bureau to fix these violations, and the bureau complied. The application of privacy law to state entities stems from a realization that some of the most egregious instances of data abuses in recent years, especially during COVID, emanated from state or quasi-state entities, not just private individuals or market actors. Most famously, perhaps, local officials in Henan once assigned red COVID health codes to a group of citizens to prevent them from traveling to protest the freezing of their bank deposits. Authorities have been sufficiently alarmed by these practices that as early as 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) issued a notice urging governments to follow personal information protection guidelines in their pandemic-control work. (At this point, the PIPL had not yet been enacted.) I take this as supporting my general argument that China’s privacy laws were enacted in large part to highlight its responsive governance in the face of new vulnerabilities and dependencies that have arisen out of China’s data-driven society. If you look at how the national legislature and state media have framed China’s recent privacy laws, they have sought to position the central Party-state as a champion of individual privacy rights against incursion from various digital bad actors—individuals, firms, even local governments. Notably missing from this list of privacy intruders is the central Party-state itself, of course, despite its leading role as a surveillant. In this regard, privacy law may also be a means of distracting the population from the central Party-state’s own privacy incursions by redirecting attention to others. You write that of the 130 countries that have enacted privacy laws, only about half are considered “free” by the nonprofit Freedom House. Why did you choose China as a case study for the role privacy laws play in these countries and to develop your theory of “authoritarian privacy”? The most immediate aim of the piece is to explain China’s turn to privacy law. I do not claim that China’s situation is universal. But I do think that a close study of China’s privacy story can help draw out some hypotheses as to why authoritarian countries have been enacting privacy laws at their present speed and scale. In the article, I discuss four objectives that motivated the central government to enact privacy laws: to support its digital economy, to expand its geopolitical influence, to enhance its national security, and (most unappreciated in my view) to respond to data-related social grievances. Not all of these motivations apply to every authoritarian ruler. China’s geopolitical goals, for instance, are decidedly more ambitious than those of Saudi Arabia or Venezuela. But it’s also the case that at least some of these motivations likely present in other authoritarian examples. The government in Vietnam, for instance, has also been highly invested in growing its digital economy, deepening its surveillance state, protecting data security, and addressing digital abuses online. Vietnam is quite close, I believe, to enacting its own information privacy law. Moreover, I think China is an interesting case because it is both the world’s leading surveillance state and a home to comprehensive personal data protections along lines inspired by the European Union’s Global Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is considered the gold standard in information privacy protection law today. Because China crystallizes that apparent paradox, I thought it could help suggest dynamics that might exist elsewhere. We often talk about the Chinese government as a monolithic entity, especially when it comes to data. What are the ways in which Party-state actors at both central and local levels have responded to the so-called “datafication of China,” and what are some examples of their competing interests in datafication? I draw on a definition of “datafication” as the process of “taking all aspects of life and turning them into data.” I think you’re absolutely right that central and local governments in China are not always 100 percent aligned in their data-related interests and priorities, including with respect to privacy. For example, some local governments that are highly invested in supporting local industry may be less willing to saddle those companies with the higher compliance costs associated with strict adherence to national data protection laws. On the other end of the spectrum, some localities may carry out central mandates more aggressively than central leaders might prefer. For example, a common pandemic-control measure implemented in residential communities required residents to use facial recognition to access their buildings. This became a sore spot for many. In 2021, the Supreme People’s Court included, in a legal notice clarifying the law on facial-recognition technology in civil cases, a provision explicitly calling on all people’s courts to “support” residents who request alternative methods of identification if their building managers mandate facial recognition technology for access. So here you see the center starting to reign in local practices that were initially implemented to carry out central mandates. What has been the role of Chinese courts in enforcing privacy protections? The PIPL provides for both administrative enforcement and judicial enforcement. The most prominent cases of enforcement, the ones we hear about in the news, tend to involve administrative processes. But courts have played an important role as well. It’s still early to draw general conclusions, as the PIPL is a relatively new law and legal disputes necessarily take time to work their way through the legal system. But early evidence on the ground suggests a few interesting trends. First, in addition to what you might think of as ordinary civil suits against privacy violators or criminal prosecutions for data fraud and theft, we see a rise in public interest data protection suits brought by local prosecutors. In one Hangzhou case, for example, a local prosecutor brought a public interest suit against a short-video app for violating the privacy rights of minors. The court supervised a mediation agreement that required the firm to follow a compliance schedule, to pay out compensation to various children’s welfare groups, and to issue a public apology in a state-owned newspaper. Some of these prosecutor-initiated public interest suits have targeted state entities—usually for a failure to adequately supervise privacy rights protection in their jurisdictions, but sometimes for direct privacy violations too. The second trend to note is more of a caveat. China’s law-enforcement apparatus may be mobilized now to carry out the privacy law’s socially protective mandate (and to boast about their success online), but these same agencies are also charged with balancing assertions of privacy rights against considerable state interests. In one case, for example, a Shandong court denied a plaintiff’s request for a pharmacy to delete her personal information because the pharmacy was not authorized to do so under local public health regulations devised for pandemic control. This shows that there are hard limits to how far law enforcers are willing to go. Policymakers in Washington, D.C. have expressed concerns that Chinese-owned software applications threaten Americans’ data security and privacy—that Chinese laws compelling companies to cooperate with intelligence services mean Americans’ sensitive data could end up in Chinese government hands. Are Washington’s anxieties warranted based on your research into how Beijing has enacted privacy laws? A key question for Chinese policymakers when drafting privacy legislation was how to further its various objectives (including predominantly domestic goals) while maintaining flexibility for state surveillance. It is well established that Chinese firms are required to share information with intelligence services under various laws, including the National Intelligence Law. The PIPL does not fundamentally alter these obligations, and I have seen no commentaries suggesting otherwise. This replicates a broader pattern that fairly describes much of Chinese law generally: even as the Party-state has legislated in various areas to serve its national objectives, it has done so through a legal regime that is carefully crafted to keep its own hands untied in core areas of national interest, including state security. In other words, the Party-state has sought to extract the benefits of law while minimizing its costs. I would hypothesize that a similar calculus also helps explain the substance of privacy laws in other authoritarian settings. It’s refreshing to hear a perspective focusing on domestic factors underpinning China’s privacy regime because so much discussion I hear about developments inside China look at everything through the lens of U.S. national security and great power competition. Why did you choose to frame your argument as a domestic legitimization story? I do see this paper as offering a corrective to a troubling tendency now in our national discourse to understand China primarily through the lens of U.S.-China competition. This is evocative of the Cold War insofar as normative ideological and geopolitical frameworks are increasingly used to structure our descriptive understandings of reality. Many analyses in the think tank literature frame the PIPL as a top-down effort to grow China’s digital economy, to enhance the country’s security, and to expand China’s data influence abroad. These explanations aren’t wrong for what they say, but they miss a critical part of the story: the Party-state’s perceived need to address data privacy incursions through socially protective legislation. This is how privacy law is discussed in Party reports, legislative documents, and state media, and it is how prosecutors, courts, and other agencies have framed their enforcement work as well. Party-state documents rarely shy away from boasting of geopolitical goals where they are relevant, and yet official PIPL-related documents scarcely mention them. The reason why I think a lot of existing explanations miss or understate the domestic legitimation piece of the story is because those accounts tend to take a fairly reductionist view of China, either as a monolith that is locked in geopolitical competition with the West, or as featuring an all-powerful totalitarian government that can essentially impose its will upon its population. But not every major piece of legislation in China today is principally motivated by geopolitics, and despite Xi Jinping’s ascendance as paramount leader in China, his rule continues to require a high level of responsiveness. Consider, in this regard, Xi’s abrupt reversal of the country’s pandemic policies after the lockdown protests last fall. How would you answer the question raised by Jamie Horsley (in a piece by this title): “How will China’s privacy law apply to the Chinese state?” How does the PIPL apply to state organs, and how does it apply to companies? Is it empowering security authorities to demand greater data access from the private sector because now they have a legal authority they can cite in making data requests? While there is an entire section in Chapter II of the PIPL devoted to state organs, that section is fairly abstract. It states that the law generally applies to state organs’ handling of personal information, while enumerating several exceptions at fairly high levels of generality. The result is that much is left to implementation. From what I have seen so far, state organs in China have sometimes been disciplined for privacy violations, often for what you might think of as inadvertent publication of private information, rather than any sort of malicious abuse of personal data. I gave an example earlier from Jiangxi of an agricultural bureau that (accidentally, it seems) disclosed the personal information of farmers online in the course of reporting local subsidies. I’ve seen other cases where a government organ was disciplined for failing to remove identifying information from various documents posted in the “Government Information Disclosure” column of its website. I would guess that drafters of the PIPL envisioned enforcement of the law against state organs for more serious violations, given the kinds of national controversies discussed earlier that helped pave the way for the Law’s enactment. For now though, initial enforcement patterns as to state agencies seem to reflect a measure of institutional and political caution in the early days of the law’s implementation. China’s technology firms have sometimes balked at sharing their data with government agencies, and have often cited a lack of legal basis as grounds for refusal. My impression is that this dynamic is beginning to change, not only because of the PIPL’s clearer specification of legal authorities, but because the state-led campaigns targeting the tech sector that started in late 2020 and 2021 have fundamentally shifted the relationship between the technology sector and the central Party-state. As Professor Angela Zhang has well documented, the Party-state had employed a relatively lax approach to tech regulation in the years before Jack Ma’s fateful address in late 2020. Now that the pendulum has swung the other direction, I would imagine technology firms are more willing to share data with central regulators when asked. I agree that the space for companies to push back is shrinking as the Party institutionalizes its power over the private sector. I have wondered what this dynamic means for the longstanding push and pull between economic goals and national and domestic security goals of the leadership. Economic growth goals have long been a backstop against implementation of some of the worst or most hardline elements of China’s cybersecurity and data regulations because officials recognize pushing companies too hard could come at a cost to investment in their jurisdictions. We saw this with data localization, with data access requests, and other cybersecurity-related audits where companies sometimes had more space to maneuver. It sounds like you are somewhat pessimistic that this space will continue, but I do wonder about it given the economic pressure facing China’s leaders. How do economic imperatives impact the way China’s privacy law is implemented and enforced? If China’s economic prospects worsen, it’s plausible to me that the center may decide to relax enforcement of not only its privacy standards, but other laws that create regulatory burdens for firms in areas like antitrust, consumer protection, and financial regulation. The costs to popular support associated with a deteriorating economy may be steeper than the legitimation and securitization benefits of a zealously enforced privacy law, especially at the margins. But I think the old days of completely lax regulations are over. Central leaders have come to appreciate more fully the political risks of overseeing unchecked technology firms helmed by ambitious entrepreneurs sitting atop mountains of sensitive data. They know too much now to turn back the clock completely.

Chinese officials say security cameras play an important role in countering crimes and maintaining social stability. [Photo/China Daily] China has no official standard governing the compression of video surveillance. Even so, Surveillance Video and Audio Coding, or SVAC, a standard that it took developers about two years to devise, has been in use by the government since May. ""China's security cameras play an important role in countering crimes and maintaining social stability,"" said Chen Chaowu, deputy director of the Ministry of Public Security's first research institute. ""In some important areas and industries, we should avoid the risks to national security that might come from using overseas standards and products."" Video surveillance in China is still dominated by foreign companies, Chen said.  According to the market research company Frost & Sullivan, multinational corporations such as the US-based Cisco Systems Inc, the South Korea-based Samsung Group and the Japan-based Sony Corp, Canon Inc and Panasonic Corp command 80 percent of the Chinese market for such equipment. Almost all foreign surveillance cameras use a coding standard known as H.264, which was established by the International Telecommunications Union, an agency of the United Nations, and has since been adopted by various countries and regions. Compared with the H.264 standard, which is better suited for use in telecommunications, the Chinese SVAC is tailored for transmitting and monitoring large amounts of online data, according to Vimicro International Corp, a developer of the standard. ""It really isn't secure to use foreign products in high-security places such as military airports and government buildings,"" said Jin Zhaowei, Vimicro president. He said the Qinghai-Tibet Railway is the first railway in China that has surveillance equipment along its entire length. Imports have supplied almost all of the components needed for the line's topographical system. To have a better means of monitoring crimes, China has introduced a national project named Safety City, which calls for the installation of more surveillance cameras. Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing and Nanjing have signed up for the project. Jin said Beijing already has about 450,000 surveillance cameras and London and New York have more. ""China's security and surveillance market has only been in existence for several years,"" he said. ""But largely thanks to favorable government policies, this industry has already seen impressive growth and looks poised for more.""

Chinese,https://www.chinafile.com/surveillance-bureaucracy,7.285782485672965,"Return to the main article Key Takeaways Budgeting for Surveillance Cameras and Software Methodology Primary Sources: Xiqiao Township’s Hierarchy of Human Needs “Xiqiao Township Facial Recognition System Construction Program” (Chinese) “2017 Harbin City Xiangfang District Public Security Branch Bureau Project Skynet Video Surveillance System Construction Program” (Chinese) Additional Data: Official PRC Place Names The Chinese government’s surveillance capabilities, while vast and impressive, do not result from one monolithic project. Rather, various central and local government and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) entities have participated in a series of initiatives spanning decades, in waves that sometimes touched upon certain parts of the country and not others, and that at other times overlapped in both space and time. Each national surveillance initiative involves its own ecosystem of localities and government actors. The resulting wave-like expansion of surveillance reflects not only the fitful process of infrastructure development in any country, but also the specific “campaign-style” in which the People’s Republic of China (PRC) implements government policy. It also shows that the Party-state’s obsession with monitoring its own citizens spans leadership changes: No matter the person at the helm, keeping tabs on “the people” is an unquestioned part of managing China. No one bureaucracy fully controls the tentacles of the surveillance state. That said, the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) often takes the lead on major initiatives. Local police, known as Public Security Bureaus or Public Security Departments, report through several levels of administrative bureaucracy up to the MPS. Notably, the MPS is a state government body, nominally separate and apart from the CCP. In the PRC, however, the Party is never completely divorced from the state’s levers of power. The composition of the larger surveillance bureaucracy ensures that the Party, not the state, is the ultimate arbiter of population monitoring. At the top of the surveillance bureaucracy sits the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission. This is a Party body, to which the Ministry of Public Security reports. This hierarchical structure is mirrored at the local level, with the Party’s local Political and Legal Affairs Commissions supervising local Public Security Bureaus. The Commission does not merely oversee law enforcement. It is also in charge of the country’s prosecutorial and judicial systems, among other domains. Until 2018, there were two other central Party organizations deeply involved in surveillance: the Central Public Security Comprehensive Management Commission, formed in 1991 and consisting of about 30 commissioners, and the Central Leading Small Group for Stability Maintenance, established in 1998 with roughly a dozen committee members. Both of these institutions were dissolved in 2018 as part of a larger reshuffle of the Chinese bureaucracy. Their responsibilities were folded into the Political and Legal Affairs Commission, leaving them within the Party’s direct ambit. “Urban management” (chengguan) bureaus at the local levels are also fixtures of the surveillance landscape. Described as perhaps “the most reviled public servants in China,” chengguan operate under the auspices of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (a state body) and act as a sort of supplemental, unarmed police force in urban areas, charged with keeping order on the streets. In practice, chengguan often end up in conflict—sometimes violent—with people living on the margins of urban life, among them “rural pushcart vendors, workers on illegal construction sites, and apartment dwellers whose homes are slated for demolition.” State government entities made up the lion’s share of purchases of the roughly 22,000 awarded bid notices, dated between June 29, 2004 and May 19, 2020, that ChinaFile analyzed. Public Security Bureaus (or, more precisely, purchasers with the term “public security” (“公安”) in their names) accounted for about 65 percent of purchasers. Urban management made up about 6 percent of purchasers, while approximately 16 percent had “people’s government” (and neither of the previous terms) in their names. On the Party side, Political and Legal Affairs Commissions accounted for about 7 percent of awarded bid notices. Purchasers with the terms “stability maintenance,” “comprehensive management,” or “petitioning” in their names—all of which refer to Party entities—accounted for 3 percent of awarded bid notices. (At the local level, these nominally separate offices are often combined into one; for example, beginning in 2008, Guangdong province had one Comprehensive Management, Petitioning, and Stability Maintenance Center at each of the county, township, and village levels.) Less than 1 percent of awarded bid notices included just the phrase “Communist Party”, referring to local Communist Party offices, and none of the other Party-related terms, in their purchaser names. A remaining 2 percent had none of the above.  The bureaucratic groupings here derive from the names of government entities listed as purchasers for awarded bid notices. Safe Cities, launched in 2003, marked the beginning of a nationwide video surveillance push. As China Digital Times explained, the Ministry of Public Security oversaw this campaign, which aimed to render, among other services, “urban management and public security maintenance.” Two years later, Safe Cities spawned Project Skynet, which promised “round-the-clock coverage of major districts, streets, schools, and business centers, and timed surveillance over minor streets” through its 20 million cameras positioned across 16 provinces and cities. (It is likely unintentional that the English translation of its name is the same as the artificial neural network attempting to eliminate humankind in the Terminator movie franchise.) In some cities (like Harbin), Skynet has also been known as the “Eye in the Sky.” Smart Cities kicked off in 2012 with the goal of fusing time-tested methods for policing and social control with new approaches made possible by the Internet of Things. The surveillance dimensions of Smart Cities don’t differ completely from those of “smart cities” the world over, which rely on data about residents’ movement and behavior to, for example, redirect traffic flows. Yet, in the PRC, the constant monitoring inherent in “smart city” design also serves the CCP’s political goals. As Leiden University’s Rogier Creemers told the Financial Times, China’s conception of “smart cities” includes “across-the-board surveillance that is partly political and partly about mechanizing ordinary street-level policing.” Procurement notices reflect these dual aims: In addition to referencing “smart policing” and “smart monitoring,” they also reflect officials’ hopes to enact tighter social control through “smart comprehensive management.” Safe Cities, Skynet, and Smart Cities focused explicitly on urban areas. To ensure adequate surveillance coverage of rural areas—as well as integration of urban and rural surveillance assets—a conglomeration of Party and state government organizations launched Project Sharp Eyes in 2015. This initiative aspires to “global coverage” of public spaces by the end of 2020. In contrast to Safe Cities, Skynet, and Smart Cities, which are overseen only by the Ministry of Public Security, nine different state and Party bodies issued the policy document that formed the basis for Sharp Eyes, a document frequently referenced in the notices ChinaFile reviewed. Three of these nine bodies—the National Development and Reform Commission, the erstwhile Central Public Security Comprehensive Management Commission, and the Ministry of Public Security—also promulgated a 2015 five-year plan for video surveillance. One procurement notice describes the responsibilities for carrying out Sharp Eyes as follows: “The Party and the government lead, comprehensive management initiates, public security is responsible, (all other) departments cooperate, and society participates.” In addition to these major initiatives, smaller projects also dot the surveillance landscape. Sometimes they are conducted under the auspices of a particular government or Party department but draw on resources from other projects. For example, in 2018, the People’s Armed Police launched a project called Boulder of Wisdom in order to improve information-sharing, create monitoring platforms, and more efficiently deploy personnel. Boulder of Wisdom incorporates facial recognition capabilities and purports to draw on Skynet information systems and other resources. Types of purchases that appear in notices referencing Skynet do not differ significantly from those in notices referencing Sharp Eyes. Some notices also refer to more than one project, for example, Safe Cities and Smart Cities, or Safe Cities and Skynet. Similarly, some notices mentioning Safe Cities use slogans commonly associated with Sharp Eyes. These overlaps demonstrate that, at least from the perspective of local authorities, the central government’s various campaigns constitute parts of a single, iterative enterprise, one whose underlying goals remain consistent and clear. —Jessica Batke and Mareike Ohlberg

 (New York) – Chinese authorities are significantly increasing policing, including arbitrary collection of DNA from residents in many towns and villages throughout the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), Human Rights Watch said today. The available information indicates that people cannot decline providing their DNA and that police do not need credible evidence of any criminal conduct. A report from Lhasa municipality in April 2022 stated that blood samples for DNA collection were being systematically collected from children at kindergartens and from other local residents. A report from a Tibetan township in Qinghai province in December 2020 stated that DNA was being collected from all boys aged 5 and above. “The Chinese government is already subjecting Tibetans to pervasive repression,” said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. “Now the authorities are literally taking blood without consent to strengthen their surveillance capabilities.” These mass DNA collection drives appear to be taking place in all seven prefectures or municipalities in the TAR, which covers the western part of the Tibetan plateau. The collection drives are part of ongoing efforts by Chinese authorities to establish police presence at the grassroots level throughout the region. There is no publicly available evidence suggesting people can decline to participate or that police have credible evidence of criminal conduct that might warrant such collection. The reports Human Rights Watch studied indicate that DNA was to be collected from all residents of these areas, including temporary residents. None of the reports indicate any conditions under which a resident could refuse to provide a sample. Human Rights Watch has identified reports of drives in 14 distinct localities (1 prefecture, 2 counties, 2 towns, 2 townships, and 7 villages) across the seven prefecture-level areas of the region, indicating that drives are taking place, or are due to take place, throughout the region. Government procurement documents show that in July 2019 the TAR police called for bids from contractors to construct a regional-level DNA database, a further indication that officials were preparing for a region-wide collection drive. In November 2019, police in Nyingtri, a prefecture-level unit of the TAR, also announced the construction of a DNA database for the area. The purpose of the DNA collection in the Chamdo municipality, one of the seven regions, was described as “improving verification efficiency and helping catch fleeing persons.” In other areas of the region, residents were told similarly that the collection of DNA was needed for general crime detection. As one official report put it, mass collection is necessary “for the public security organs to detect various illegal cases, and to effectively crack down on illegal and criminal elements.” Researchers outside China said in 2020 that mass DNA collection began in the TAR in 2013. These claims were based on official news reporting about a mass health-check scheme called the Physicals for All program, which started in TAR in 2013. The program’s stated goal is to improve healthcare delivery, but in Xinjiang, the authorities used it to surreptitiously collect en masse the DNA of residents aged 12 to 65, according to an official document Human Rights Watch obtained in 2017. Human Rights Watch has not found any information indicating that authorities in the TAR have used such programs for DNA collection. Police in other areas of China have also been carrying out large-scale DNA collection since the early 2010s. But available evidence suggests those efforts have been limited either to subsets of the population the police consider problematic, such as migrants, former prisoners, criminal suspects, and other social groups categorized as “focus personnel” by security agencies, or since 2017, to a police program throughout China collecting the DNA of an estimated 8.1 to 26.4 percent of all males in the country. Coercing people to give blood samples, or taking blood samples without informed, meaningful, and freely given consent or justification, can violate an individual’s privacy, dignity, and right to bodily integrity. It can also in some circumstances constitute degrading treatment. Compelled DNA sampling of an entire region or population for security maintenance is a serious human rights violation, in that it cannot be justified as necessary or proportionate. The right to respect for confidentiality of medical information is also a core principle of the right to health. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has advised states that “[a]ll health facilities, goods and services must be … designed to respect confidentiality.” While the right to privacy does not establish an absolute rule of confidentiality of medical information, interference or breach of confidentiality must be strictly justified, which is not the case when such collection is intended to routinely be shared with the police and any other agency with access to the database. DNA information is highly sensitive and can facilitate a wide array of abuses if collected or shared non-consensually. Any compelled collection or use by the government is a serious intrusion on the right to privacy. While the government’s collection of DNA is sometimes justified as a permissible investigative tool, this type of interference with the right to privacy must be comprehensively regulated, narrow in scope, and proportionate to meeting a legitimate security goal. Yet the Chinese government data collection drives collect DNA information from everyone, regardless of whether they are in any way linked to a criminal investigation, and do not appear to require informed consent or explanation of why DNA samples are sought. Children’s privacy is vital to ensuring their safety, agency, and dignity, and any restriction upon a child’s privacy is only permissible if it meets the standards of legality, necessity, and proportionality. The collection, processing, and use of genetic information poses heightened risks to children’s privacy. DNA holds highly sensitive information that would uniquely and permanently identify a child, their family members, and inherited medical conditions that could lead to disabilities and major health problems. The use and exposure of this data “may have adverse consequences on children, which can continue to affect them at later stages of their lives.” The authorities’ collection of DNA from children without their informed, meaningful, and freely given consent, or that of their caregivers, and extracted in educational settings where they could not meaningfully opt out or refuse to provide their personal health data, is a violation of children’s privacy. Furthermore, the authorities’ stated use for this data – crime detection – does not appear to constitute a legitimate, proportionate purpose that serves the child’s best interest. DNA collection in villages has been reported as part of the drive by Chinese authorities in the region in January 2022 called “The Three Greats.” Official media reports from seven areas across the region – Lhodrak (Lhokha), Gyatsa (Lhokha), Nedong (Lhokha), Chonggye (Lhokha), Chushul (Lhasa), Lhasa city (Lhasa), and Bayi (Nyingtri) – describe the drive as one of several ongoing efforts to “strengthen the grass-roots social governance system,” primarily by increasing police presence at village level, which previously extended only as far as administrative centers referred to as townships (Ch: xiang). Known in full as “Great One-by-one Inspection, Great Investigation and Great Mediation” (da zou fang 大走访、da diao yan 大调研、da hua jie 大化解) this drive requires police in newly established village police stations or nearby township-level police stations (paichusuo) to visit each household and question residents about their views. Police carrying out The Three Greats drive in Lhodrak, a county in southern Tibet, were told “go to the village and enter [each] household to carry out a net-type investigation to find out the truth.” “Three real 'greats' for Tibetans would involve an immediate end to these chilling violations, and investigations and prosecutions of those responsible,” Richardson said. For additional details, please see below. DNA Collection Drives in Tibet According to official media reports, drives to collect DNA from the residents of a given area have taken place in region since 2019. The report from Chamdo municipality in May 2019 specifies that DNA was to be collected from the entire population, and notes that police were told “not to miss a [single] village or monastery, and not to miss a [single] household or person.” By May 2019, 3,737 police in Chamdo had collected data from at least 524,500 people in the municipality, 69 percent of the population. As a result, they had assembled “1,500 clues” from the data; these had enabled them to arrest “26 fugitives of various types, especially in the special operation of ‘sweeping gangsters, eliminating evil and fighting against chaos.’” A police report from Chonggye county in Lhokha municipality, where police were collecting “basic information” and DNA samples between early December 2021 and late January 2022, part of the drive called “the Three Greats” (Da zou fang, da diaoyan, da huajie), said that “no village must be omitted from a township, no household must be omitted from a village, and no person must be omitted from a household.” In April 2022, a report by the Nyima County Public Security Bureau in Nagchu noted that officials had collected DNA from almost all residents except those working outside the county. Other official reports seen by Human Rights Watch document DNA collection drives in Tibetan areas outside the TAR. Only two of these reports – from the townships of Mentang in Golok prefecture and Dritoe in Yushu municipality, both in Qinghai in 2021 – indicate that DNA was being collected from all residents of those areas. Six other reports from Tibetan-inhabited towns or townships in Golok and Hainan prefectures in Qinghai, and from Bathang County in Sichuan province, describe DNA collection from males only, as in other parts of China. Several reports indicate that children as young as five have been included in some of the DNA collection drives. In the town of Xia Dawu in Golok prefecture, police announced in December 2020 that DNA had to be collected from all males between 5 and 60, although requirements earlier that year had set the minimum age at 16. Photographs in a report from Qingzheng township in Golok in April 2021 show DNA being taken by police from boys in the first year of primary school. The reports do not provide evidence that children, or their caregivers, gave consent for their DNA blood samples to be taken. The Qingzheng report, for example, says that local auxiliary police “patiently explained” to the children the reasons for collecting their DNA and “promptly eliminated the confusion and doubts of the collected personnel.” An April 2022 report on the DNA collection drive in kindergartens in Nyemo county, in Lhasa municipality in the TAR, states that police explained in detail “the necessity and importance of DNA samples collected by the public security organs,” and thus “promptly eliminated the doubts and concerns of the masses and obtained the support and understanding of the collected persons for this work.” In another kindergarten in Nyemo, the report says, police “got the support and understanding of the work from the teachers and students in the school.” There is no suggestion in these reports that parents were involved in the consent process. In TAR, available evidence suggests that prior to 2019, police DNA collection also focused on certain subsets of the population. For example, in July 2015, police in Lhasa announced the purchase of DNA testing and detection database for forensic purposes at a cost of 10 million yuan (US$1.6 million), probably to assess DNA collected from suspects, and in March 2018, police in a village in Taktse county, Lhasa, collected DNA from all migrant workers in the area, but not apparently from all registered residents. The mass DNA collective drives in TAR since 2019 significantly expand the authorities’ collection of such biodata beyond previous government efforts in the region. DNA collection from each resident in localities with Tibet is significant not just in terms of concerns about consent or privacy; it represents a further advance in close management of the population by the government. Because it requires contact with and registration of each individual, it allows Chinese authorities to identify, tabulate, and track all people in a given area. The fact that such collection is selective in other parts of China but widespread in many, and likely, in most areas of the TAR and Xinjiang, shows that the authorities feel an especially urgent need to increase data acquisition and monitoring capacity at the grassroots level in those two regions. Mass DNA collection is a logical extension of prior extensive surveillance and deepening police presence there, in Tibet notably via “The Three Greats” drives and other village-level policing initiatives, key elements of which are detailed below. The Three Greats’ Drives DNA collection drives in Tibet coincided with the “Three Greats” drives in some areas. Both involve data collection about every individual within a village. According to official media reports from Gyatsa county and Bayi town in the TAR, police carrying out the Three Greats drive have to apply a principle known as “one household, one file” or “one household member, one policeman,” meaning that a designated police officer is responsible for compiling information on each household and each person. Public Security Bureau reports describe the collection of information about individual thinking and opinion as “establishing direct police-people relations” and as “spreading information tentacles.” The authorities say the information is intended to improve service provision, such as advising residents to avoid online fraud or listing elderly people who need assistance. Almost all reports also state that a primary purpose is identifying disputes that the officials can then resolve (the third of the Three Greats: “Great Mediation”). Since at least 2018 Chinese authorities have banned anyone except government and Communist Party officials from carrying out even informal dispute mediation, an important civil function in Tibet that lamas, village elders, or other locally respected figures had generally conducted earlier. Security agencies regard local disputes as a potential source of unrest, and in practice, the aim of resolving “disputes” and collecting “opinions and suggestions put forward by the masses” appears to be to identify and suppress popular dissent. A report from Lhodrak county in southern Tibet, for example, specifies that the police must solicit individuals' opinions about “demolitions and relocation.” This move appears to be designed to identify local resistance to relocation. Several thousand villagers in Lhodrak are being resettled in remote border locations, and some official reports describe intensive, years-long efforts to get residents to agree. Chinese officials take elaborate measures to prevent villagers from returning to their original homes, and officials are required by law to demolish the former houses of relocated villagers to prevent them from returning. The intensification of police presence at the local level and the practice of household visits is part of an ongoing nationwide drive known as the “Fengqiao” or “Maple Bridge experience,” after a social control experiment from the Maoist era when local residents were encouraged to provide information and support to police. The Fengqiao drive, like the Three Greats, is presented as a form of public service and emphasizes that mediation of local disputes should be carried out only by police and local officials. As the slogan for this work indicates – “keep small things in the village, keep big things in the village, prevent conflicts from being handed upwards” – the authorities’ objective is to engage local residents in supporting police work by reporting information about others, and to prevent local people from taking their grievances to higher-level authorities and control the spread of dissent to other communities. Other stated objectives of the current drives are the catch-all “elimination of hidden threats to social stability,” and “strengthening the mapping and management of key persons.” The term “key persons” or “focus personnel” (zhongdian renyuan) refers to individuals or types of individuals arbitrarily deemed a potential threat to stability, and subject to control by Public Security. A similar drive in the Kandze (Ch.: Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan province has introduced police posts staffed by fulltime auxiliary personnel. These uniformed auxiliaries are also expected to conduct home visits to collect data and mediate disputes and achieve “zero distance from the masses” through constant proximity, both face to face and in village WeChat groups. In Sershul (Ch.: Shiqu) county, part of Kandze prefecture, official media term the village policing drive as “micro police and village police.” Official reports have emphasized that auxiliaries stationed in these villages as part of this initiative provide public education to counter online fraud. According to researchers with exile monitoring organizations, however, police in Sershul detained 117 Tibetans in 2021 for weeks of extrajudicial re-education after searches of their phones revealed what authorities claim was banned content. Human Rights Watch has confirmed recent exile media reports of the systematic searching of mobile phones for banned text and images by local police in rural areas in Nagchu (Ch.: Naqu) municipality, TAR. Village Policing Under the “social management” approach introduced by the former leader Hu Jintao and elaborated by Xi Jinping, authorities have intensified local-level policing, usually in the name of “grassroots governance” or better service provision. In the TAR, the current process began in 2011, when teams of cadres were sent to reside in every village of the region to carry out political education, social services, and other functions. In May 2012, “grid management” and other technologically-assisted forms of urban neighborhood surveillance and preventive policing were introduced systematically throughout urban neighborhoods (known as “communities” in Chinese) to provide enhanced security management at the block level. In May 2013, all households in the TAR were organized into units known as Advanced Double Liaison Households (Ch.: shuanglianhu), each consisting of 5 to 10 households led by a huzhang or household-head responsible for liaising with the neighborhood or village authorities about political compliance and service needs within each unit. At this stage, police stations in Tibetan rural areas were located in townships, not villages. This changed in Qinghai province in October 2015, when an announcement appeared in Qinghai province official media that over 5,000 police officers – approximately 10-20 percent of the Qinghai police force – were to be transferred to work in villages, where each would serve for two years. A month later, in November 2015, an additional 4,530 new recruits began training to become “village police” in Qinghai. State media reported that they would carry out work “such as preventive control of social stability, fighting crime, monitoring social media and internet messaging, gathering information and management of the actual population.” That same month, Qinghai officials announced that pilot projects from Golok Darlak and Xunhua counties to “strengthen building of grassroots stability” would expand to the entire province. The goal was described as “establishment and building of security cells” as part of a “three-dimensional control system for social stability.” This system was part of a call by Zhang Gongrong, head of the Qinghai provincial Politics and Law Committee, to increase “the capacity of grassroots police and village police” to “vigorously eliminate the danger of instability.” Village police stations started to appear in the TAR by July 2020, when the first Fengqiao police stations were established in 17 of the 20 administrative villages in Chushul, a county near Lhasa, as a pilot scheme. Since then, reports indicate village police stations have been established in other areas of the TAR, including Shigatse and Chamdo. A number of village-level police stations have also been established in the new villages being constructed along Tibet’s southern borders, such as Tsari in Lhuntse county, Nagchu in Drongba county, and Ruomoxin in Gamba county. The intensification of police presence and activity at the grassroots level in rural areas appears designed to extend the surveillance capacity achieved in urban areas to the communities where the majority of Tibetans still live, which have been subject to wide-ranging state intervention under current development policies. It is part of a broader effort by the authorities to promote “grassroots governance” and “rule of law,” which in fact has involved attacks on civil society groups and village leaders, notably those associated with local opposition to official corruption and damage to the environment, or promotion of Tibetan language. This approach was confirmed in the 2018-21 “Anti-Gang-Crime” campaign, which targeted social associations and activists as “underworld forces.” That campaign has since been made a regular part of Public Security work at all levels. A report on the work of a team from the Anti-Gang-Crime campaign headquarters for Bayi Qu, the main city in Nyingtri (Ch.: Linzhi) municipality, “going to the grassroots and households for Great Questioning” was the first of four tasks undertaken this year.

 (New York) – A big data program for policing in China’s Xinjiang region arbitrarily selects Turkic Muslims for possible detention, Human Rights Watch said today. A leaked list of over 2,000 detainees from Aksu prefecture provided to Human Rights Watch is further evidence of China’s use of technology in its repression of the Muslim population.

The big data program, the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), apparently flagged the people on the Aksu List, whom officials then evaluated and sent to “political education” camps in Xinjiang.

“The Aksu List provides further insights into how China’s brutal repression of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology,” said Maya Wang, senior China researcher. “The Chinese government owes answers to the families of those on the list: why were they detained, and where are they now?”

Human Rights Watch first reported on the IJOP in February 2018, noting that the policing program aggregates data about people from various sensory systems in Xinjiang, and flags to officials those it deems potentially threatening. Officials then evaluate these individuals’ “general performance” together with other sources of information, and send some to political education camps and other facilities. Human Rights Watch “reverse engineered” the IJOP mobile app in May 2019 and revealed the dubious criteria this mass surveillance system was programmed to flag, including many lawful behaviors.

The Aksu List, dated around late 2018, is similar to another leaked file, the Karakax List. That list–of people detained for having relatives abroad–dated around June 2019, provides an assessment of whether an individual should remain in detention. The IJOP is also repeatedly mentioned in the Karakax List. Together the lists provide two snapshots of Xinjiang’s bureaucracy, as it picks and vets its victims in the process of coerced thought transformation: the decision to detain people and the decision to keep them in detention. At both stages, the IJOP system assists officials in selecting targets.

The entry for “Ms. T” on the Aksu List illustrates how the program’s algorithms identify legal behaviors as grounds for detention. It notes that she was detained because the IJOP system had flagged her for “links to sensitive countries.” It reported that Ms. T had received four calls from a foreign number in March 2017, down to the number of seconds. In other words, the IJOP system is programed to pick out particular behavior, calls to a foreign number, noting the precise duration of the calls. Human Rights Watch called that number and found that it belongs to Ms. T’s sister.

Ms. T’s sister said that Xinjiang police interrogated Ms. T around the time the Aksu List recorded her detention date. The police had specifically asked about her sister because she lives abroad. Ms. T’s sister said she has had no direct contact with her family in Xinjiang since then, but heard via an intermediary that Ms. T—presumably upon her release from a political education camp—was now working in a factory five days a week and allowed to go home only on weekends. Ms. T’s sister believes Ms. T is being forced to work in a factory against her will, noting that Ms. T had been training for a different career before she was detained.

Human Rights Watch’s analysis of the Aksu List strongly suggests that the vast majority of the people flagged by the IJOP system are detained for everyday lawful, non-violent behavior. This contradicts the Chinese authorities’ claims that their “sophisticated,” “predictive” technologies, like the IJOP, are keeping Xinjiang safe by “targeting” criminals “with precision.”

The mass surveillance and arbitrary detention of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims violate fundamental rights under China’s constitution and international human rights law. Article 37 of the constitution states that all arrests must be approved by either the procuratorate (the state prosecution agency) or the courts.

Yet Human Rights Watch research indicates that neither agency appears to be involved in these detentions. Rather, administrative officials, including police officers, make the sole decision to detain someone. Those facing detention have no right to due process, including access to lawyers and family members, or a chance to stand trial to contest such allegations. The use of intrusive surveillance, including in and around people’s homes, also violates everyone’s right to privacy.

“‘Predictive policing’ platforms are really just a pseudo-scientific fig leaf for the Chinese government to justify vast repression of Turkic Muslims,” Wang said. “The Chinese government should immediately shut down the IJOP, delete all the data it has collected, and release everyone arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang.” Reverse Engineering a Xinjiang Police Mass Surveillance App Download the full report in English Download the appendix of the report in English لتنزيل الملخص والتوصيات بالعربية Unduh ringkasan dan rekomendasi dalam [Bahasa Indonesia] Télécharger le résumé et les recommandations en français Descargue aquí el resumen y las recomendaciones en español ئۇيغۇر تىلىدىكى قىسقىچە مەزمۇنى ۋە تەۋسىيەلىرىنى چۈشۈرۈڭ: Türkçe dilinde rapor özeti ve tavsiyeleri indirmek için tıklayınız 摘要和建议有中文版本 The Aksu List: Authentication
In August, Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur Service provided Human Rights Watch with an Excel spreadsheet titled “List of IJOP Trainees” with the names of over 2,000 people obtained from an anonymous Xinjiang source in late 2018. The sheet has columns that include the person’s name, gender, the date of their detention in a political education camp, the reason for their detention, the number of their detention facility or cell, the batch number from which the IJOP systems picked them out, and the reason why, usually no more than a sentence or two.

Although the sender has not been identified, the list appears to come from a part of Aksu prefecture where 80 percent of the residents are Uyghurs. Human Rights Watch is confident that all the people on the Aksu List are Uyghurs. About half of the list are men and the other half women. Their detention dates ranged from mid-2016 to late 2018. At the peak, well over 100 people were detained on a single day. To protect the source, Human Rights Watch is obscuring the precise location of the Aksu List, precise dates, and some of the numbers throughout the analysis.

The file’s metadata suggests that it was last modified in late 2018. Human Rights Watch used various methods to verify the Aksu List: The language and terms used in the Aksu List are also consistent with those in other Xinjiang official documents that Human Rights Watch reviewed. Human Rights Watch has shown the full Aksu List to two experts who have extensively documented Xinjiang’s repression. They determined that the list appears authentic based on details such as detention duration and the language used.

The same Xinjiang source who provided the Aksu List also provided other audiovisual content to Radio Free Asia’s Uyghur Service between mid and late 2018. Human Rights Watch analyzed this material to assess the credibility of the Excel spreadsheet, as it was obtained from the same source.

To protect the anonymous source, Human Rights Watch will not describe specifics of the analysis performed, but concluded that the audiovisual content was taken from inside a detention facility in Aksu. The embedded geographic coordinates suggest that they were taken from within a large building complex previously identified as a political education camp by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think tank. This analysis provides Human Rights Watch with additional confidence in the authenticity of the Aksu List.

The Aksu List: Analysis
According to the Aksu List, the IJOP can flag people at both the prefecture and regional levels, though it is unclear how, or if, those two levels of analysis differ. At both levels, most people were flagged for their relationships, their communications (通联), or for being related to (家族人员 or 亲属), or traveling, or staying with (同行同住) someone the authorities consider suspicious. Column F appears to be the reasons officials give for detaining a person. An examination of the Aksu List suggests that the authorities consider the following behavior suspicious: In some cases, the alleged “problematic” behaviors dated to years earlier, revealing broad surveillance of legal and non-violent behavior going back decades. In one case, a man was detained for having studied the Quran in the mid-80s, and having “let his wife wear a veil” in the early 2000s. In another case, a woman was detained for once going to Kashgar, and once staying overnight in Hotan, both in 2013.

The authorities listed “terrorism” and “extremism,” both perilously over-expansive terms in Chinese law, as the reasons for detaining about 10 percent (or over 200) of the people on the list. Yet the authorities did not allege that these detainees committed, incited, supported, or plotted any acts of violence, much less any acts that would rise to the level of terrorism. About one in five in this group were tagged for downloading or sharing “terrorism” or “extremism” content. About four in five were listed as being related to someone who had downloaded or shared such content, or to someone who was detained for terrorism or extremism. The Aksu List does not provide any additional information on the content of such audiovisual materials.

Governments may prosecute speech that incites criminal acts—speech that directly encourages the commission of a crime, is intended to result in criminal action, or is likely to result in criminal action—whether or not criminal action does, in fact, result. But laws that impose criminal punishment for what has been called “indirect incitement”—for example, justifying or glorifying terrorism—encroach on expression protected under international human rights law.

An examination of the Aksu List suggests that Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims are presumed guilty until proven innocent. In one case, a man was sent to political education camp because “suspicion [of him] cannot be eliminated and would require further interrogation.” The evidence suggests that, consistent with official rhetoric, political education is akin to a form of preventive detention, where people’s behaviors are deemed vaguely suspicious but not criminal. They are being held until their loyalty can be ascertained and, as needed, instilled.

Notably, three cases in the Aksu List suggest that people are treated with different levels of “strictness” depending on their level of obedience, and that people who disobey or “talk back” are placed in areas with stricter management. There appear to be three levels: “common management” (普管区), “strict management” (严管区), and “strong management” (强管区). The list also shows that some people are allowed to return home when they are sick (or in one case, breastfeeding), but are sent back to detention once they regain their health.

Human Cogs in the Machine
Previous Human Rights Watch research suggests that the IJOP system’s requirements for officials to respond to many perceived abnormalities in people’s lives is grueling. In mid-2019, Human Rights Watch was able to speak with an official in the region involved in carrying out the IJOP system. The person said: From 2016 to mid-2018 we were arresting people. In the beginning we were arresting those who spread terrorism videos, those who receive or give funds to ETIM, [and] those who participated in riots, and we would send them to the local political education centers. Later on … there were quotas for arrests in all the locales, and so we began to arrest people randomly: people who argue in the neighborhood, people who street fight, drunkards, people who are lazy; we would arrest them and accuse them of being extremists. There was not enough room for them all in the centers, so they built new ones.… In the beginning when the IJOP system came live, if [we] labeled someone as suspicious during evaluation, the local village committee and the police would go and take the person into custody. Later on, we rarely marked someone as suspicious. Often … we asked them leading questions. Let’s say we had to evaluate a person whom the system had lost track of. We’d [go to his home and] ask, “these last few days you were working the fields? You didn’t go anywhere?” As long as they said yes, we’d fill out [the form in the app] noting the villager said he was working in the fields, he didn’t go anywhere but everything was fine. It was like that for all other verification tasks.” The use of automation—which the authorities claim helps them identify those harboring the “ideological virus” of being disloyal to the Chinese Communist Party in a thorough and “precise” manner—can also lead to sloppy policing. The official said:   [W]e wouldn’t be able to finish the many verification tasks if we were to go through them all seriously.… But because we’ve been working [like this] for so long, whether it is our conscience or that we are tired, right now what’s left [among officials] is just grievances and complaints; everyone wants to leave, nobody is doing this work properly. Mission Creep
Information that has recently come to light from 2018 and 2019 suggests that the IJOP is used not only for picking out targets for detention, as described in the May 2019 Human Rights Watch report, but also to provide data for Xinjiang’s larger government information system, that powers a range of government functions. This suggests that the authorities are increasingly sharing personal information across government agencies.

Government reports state that data collected via the IJOP system is also being used for a variety of vetting tasks, from screening applicants for police jobs or public services such as poverty alleviation programs, to picking out model Communist Party members. Neither the initial collection of personal data nor the sharing and use of such data involve asking for consent, illustrating how powerless Xinjiang’s residents are.

In Turpan County, for example, officials vet people using the IJOP system to select politically reliable people to take part in a “labor transfer” scheme; a program that involves organizing and transporting groups of Uyghurs to work in factories elsewhere in China under closely supervised, and often coercive, conditions. The same Turpan County scheme also draws on information gathered from “Physicals for All,” another compulsory data collection program in which medical and health data is collected.

The integration of the IJOP system with other government systems, illustrates China’s expansive definition of security and perceived need for extensive surveillance and control. In Xinjiang, the IJOP system is connected to information databases on second-hand cars, allowing the authorities to “compare information between persons and vehicles in real time, to discover suspicious clues in a timely manner, and to use information technology to effectively eliminate and prevent criminals from using second-hand vehicles to engage in various criminal activities that endanger the safety of society, as a publicly-available Xinjiang Department of Commerce notice says.” The notice further explains: Each automobile trading hall in our region is equipped with ID card recognition devices and video image capture systems to examine the ID cards, residence permits, community certificates, convenient contact card, vehicle information … of both buyers and sellers, to ensure that the person and their identity match. The information is uploaded to the Xinjiang Traffic Police Headquarters in a timely manner. There is some preliminary evidence that the IJOP system itself is being used in China outside of Xinjiang. China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), the same company that built the IJOP in Xinjiang, built an IJOP system in Yinchuan, the capital of Ningxia province, says a procurement document dated January 2020 (for RMB 280.98 million, nearly US$43 million). CETC did not respond to a Human Rights Watch request for comment. Ningxia has the country’s highest concentration of ethnic Hui, also a Muslim (though not Turkic) minority. While it is unclear how the system is being used, religious restrictions on Hui Muslims—closing mosques and Arabic-language schools, scrubbing Arabic scripts from Halal restaurants—have been on the rise in Ningxia and other Hui Muslim areas since 2019.

 “I thought the days when humans are ruled by machines and algorithms won’t happen for at least another 50 years. [But] this coronavirus epidemic has suddenly brought it on early,” a blogger on the popular Chinese forum Zhihu wrote. The blogger was complaining about Health Code, an app that local authorities around China rely on to make decisions about quarantining individuals amid the COVID-19 outbreak. The Chinese authorities are notorious for using technology for surveillance, unconstrained by privacy legislation, a free press, robust civil society, or an independent legal system. In Xinjiang, northwestern China, police over the last few years have collected residents’ biometrics without their consent. This and other data has been used to evaluate the level of political loyalty of the region’s 12 million Turkic Muslim minority residents and to determine how much freedom of movement they will be allowed. How does Health Code work? People first fill in their personal information, including their ID number, where they live, whether they have been with people carrying the virus, and their symptoms. The app then churns out one of three colors: green means they can go anywhere, yellow and red mean seven and 14 days of quarantine, respectively. The app also surreptitiously collects – and shares with the police – people’s location data. The app’s color determination has a wide-ranging impact on the lives of its 700 million users, as local authorities throughout China require people to show their app when they hail a ride, go to supermarkets, or enter and exit residential areas and the subway. Their ability to move around, earn a living, and even obtain necessities and medical care are dependent on the app’s tri-color code. The access control systems of some residential areas even use facial recognition technology, allowing only those with green code to enter, indicating that these systems are linked. Exactly how companies designed the app and the criteria they use to categorize people remain unclear. The Zhejiang provincial government has promulgated a set of standards for the Health Code app, outlining broad and ambiguous criteria for categorization. “Having been to affected areas recently” and “belonging to groups relevant to the epidemic” are two of seven criteria that can turn a user’s code red. Other local governments are authorized to establish rules for carrying out these criteria in their districts. Without further insight into the inner workings of the app it is hard for people to make sense of the color they are assigned, or what circumstances might trigger a change in color.

""When the system finds an object falling from a height in a residential area, it can automatically trace its arc and locate the exact window it came from,"" said Sun Yongliang, a senior manager in charge of smart city projects at Hisense TransTech, a subsidiary of Hisense Group. ""At the same time, the system can notify security staff or the residential area's administrators,"" Sun said on Monday. He said the system performs better than traditional surveillance cameras, which usually require a video to be played back to locate where the item came from. ""Thanks to the algorithm, the system can also get rid of normal incidents, such as rain water or unintentional acts,"" Sun added. The system is expected to be applied soon in five communities in the Shinan district of Qingdao, Shandong province, where Hisense Group is headquartered. In recent years, strong winds knocking objects from tall buildings or some people intentionally throwing objects out of windows has become a huge safety concern. However, such incidents usually happen without witnesses, and it's hard to punish those responsible. Lian Junpeng, Party chief of the Tianshan community in Shinan, is looking forward to the new surveillance system being installed in the city. ""The surveillance cameras assure residents that their safety is more guaranteed than before,"" he said. Hisense Group said the development of the system is part of joint efforts with partners to build a smart city demonstration zone in Shinan district, ranging from culture, tourism and residential administration to industrial park operation. The comprehensive project is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

    Police forces in the UK are shot through with Chinese camera technology, according to a survey by the Office of the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner.
 We note that the survey returns gave the impression that 2 forces were using Hikvision body worn cameras. However, subsequent enquiries have shown that to be incorrect. Consequently, the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner can report that none of the forces who replied to the survey used body worn cameras manufactured by Hikvision. The survey, conducted by the Office of the Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner (OBSCC) in the second half of 2022, asked all 43 police force areas in England and Wales, as well as the British Transport Police, the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, the Ministry of Defence, and the National Crime Agency, about their use and governance of public surveillance camera systems including on drones and helicopters, body-worn video, ANPR (automatic number plate recognition), and any other relevant systems.  Thirty-nine responses were received out of a possible total of 47. Key findings include that: at least 18 respondents say that their external camera systems use equipment about which there have been security or ethical concerns (including Dahua, Hikvision, Honeywell and Huawei, and Nuuo) at least 24 respondents say that their internal camera systems use equipment about which there have been security or ethical concerns (including Dahua, Hikvision, Honeywell and Huawei, and Nuuo) at least 11 respondents say their ANPR systems use equipment about which there have been security or ethical concerns at least 2 respondents use cameras made by Hikvision in their body-worn video systems 23 of the 31 respondents who said they operate cameras on drones / unmanned aerial vehicles (variously with video, audio, and thermal imaging and/or night vision capability), said they were aware of security or ethical concerns about the manufacturer of their drones, Chinese company, DJI Biometrics and Surveillance Camera Commissioner Fraser Sampson said: It is abundantly clear from this detailed analysis of the survey results that the police estate in the UK is shot through with Chinese surveillance cameras. It is also clear that the forces deploying this equipment are generally aware that there are security and ethical concerns about the companies that supply their kit. There has been a lot in the news in recent days about how concerned we should be about Chinese spy balloons 60,000 feet up in the sky. I do not understand why we are not at least as concerned about the Chinese cameras 6 feet above our head in the street and elsewhere. Clearly it is vital sometimes that the police must be able to use intrusive surveillance technology in public places. But if they want the public to trust them to do so, they must be able to persuade us, not only that they are working partners and providers that can be trusted, but also that they will use the technology available to them lawfully, responsibly and according to a set of clear agreed principles. Parliament has already acted to curtail the use of equipment made by several Chinese manufacturers from some areas of public life where security is key. Myself and others have been saying for some time that we should, both for security and ethical reasons, really be asking ourselves whether it is ever appropriate for public bodies to use equipment made by companies with such serious questions hanging over them. The OBSCC sent the survey to the chief officers of the 47 policing bodies in June 2022. The document followed the format of earlier surveys conducted by the Surveillance Camera Commissioner in 2017 and 2019. The response rates for previous surveys had been 100%, but the rate for the 2022 survey fell to 91% (39 out of a possible 47) despite responses being accepted more than 3 months after the initial deadline.  The survey report notes that the 2022 return was “disappointing [with] some noticeable absences in returns this time, including some of the larger police forces.”  A list of the bodies that did respond is included in an appendix at the end of the report. The 8 which did not complete the survey were: City of London Police, Gloucestershire Police, Greater Manchester Police, Gwent Police, Merseyside Police, National Crime Agency (NCA), South Yorkshire Police, Thames Valley Police. An initial analysis of the survey was published in November 2022.

According to a procurement notice from August, officials in Kaijiang want cameras that “support detection of more than 60 faces simultaneously”. The local system should be fast enough to analyse up to 100 faces per second and have the capacity to store up to 1.8bn images (Kaijiang has a population of 410,000).

Bulelani Jili  Executive summaryIntroductionChina’s domestic tech environmentCyber Sovereignty Public-private partnerships China’s political and legal environment  Conclusion    This paper seeks to offer insights into how China’s domestic surveillance market and cyber capability ecosystem operate, especially given the limited number of systematic studies that have analyzed its industry objectives. For the Chinese government, investment in surveillance technologies advances both its ambitions of becoming a global technology leader as well as its means of domestic social control. These developments also foster further collaboration between state security actors and private tech firms. Accordingly, the tech firms that support state cyber capabilities range from small cyber research start-ups to leading global tech enterprises. The state promotes surveillance technology and practices abroad through diplomatic exchanges, law enforcement cooperation, and training programs. These efforts encourage the dissemination of surveillance devices, but also support the government’s goals concerning international norm-making in multilateral and regional institutions. The proliferation of Chinese surveillance technology and cyber tools and the associated linkages between both state and private Chinese entities with those in other states, especially in the Global South, is a valuable component of Chinese state efforts to expand and strengthen their political and economic influence worldwide. Although individual governments purchasing Chinese digital tools have their local ambitions in mind, Beijing’s export and promotion of domestic surveillance technologies shape the adoption of these tools in the Global South. As such, investigating how Chinese actors leverage demand factors for their own aims, does not undercut the ability of other countries to detect and determine outcomes. Rather it demonstrates an interplay between Chinese state strategy and local political environments. This paper specifically focuses on key features in China’s surveillance ecosystem, while the companion to this report will focus on the key ‘pull factors’  from African countries and their significance for US interests. Chinese tech companies are among the largest firms in the world. Initially focused on the domestic market, they now sell various surveillance technologies to a global customer base. Increased collaboration between the party-state and private Chinese actors in the sale of surveillance products inspires trepidations about the proliferation of China’s surveillance tools, ergo the rise of unwarranted surveillance. Namely, researchers scrutinize China’s diplomatic activities, raising questions about the degree to which the government enables surveillance practices abroad. Large Chinese firms and state amplify debate and concerns by pushing to change the norms and mechanisms in the use of public security technology. This paper seeks to offer insights into how China’s domestic surveillance market and cyber capability ecosystem operate, especially given the limited number of systematic studies on the industry and its growing influence in the Global South. This issue brief focuses on the development of the Chinese surveillance industry and the firms that make it possible, including those firms that sell surveillance tools within the international surveillance market. The brief has four parts. The first discusses the development of China’s surveillance ecosystem. It specifically explores the establishment of the Golden Shield Project (GSP), a national Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) network intended to digitize the public security sector, and its consequences for surveillance practices in China. The second section investigates China’s conception of “cyber sovereignty,” or wangluo zhuquan, which seeks to influence the governance of cyberspace. This idea and policy prerogative helps Beijing’s promotion of a controlled cyberspace and, therefore, the development of surveillance practices that rely on the use of artificial intelligence, big data, and biometric collection, among other means, to monitor citizens. The third and fourth sections carefully look at how private-public partnerships have empowered China’s cyberpower, while at the same time creating a more restrictive legal and political environment in China. What appears to make the party-state distinct from other exporters is the legal and political system from which these surveillance tools emerge—crucially, how China promotes their use in the Global South.1 The brief concludes by taking a close look at how the spread of Chinese surveillance tools is both a consequence of China’s supply capacity and local demand factors. In 2014, President Xi Jinping declared that there was “no national security without cybersecurity.”2 For the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), surveillance technology research and development support the party’s intention to be a global technology leader while also augmenting its means of domestic social control. Promoting social stability has been the chief policy goal of the party, and therefore the state, for years.3 As early as 1990, the State Council approved a proposal to establish a national information system.4 This includes the Golden Shield, or jindun gongcheng program. GSP is a surveillance initiative launched by the state in 1998. Promoted by public security authorities, the primary aim of the initiative is to create a fully digitized public security sector using a national surveillance network to bolster the means of data management and state security capabilities. Walton’s seminal report, “China’s Golden Shield Corporations and the Development of Surveillance Technology in The People’s Republic of China,” examines the early developments of GSP.5 Walton’s work examines how the initiative relied on American and Canadian made technology. Recent government bidding documents show further evidence that American companies supply some of the parts necessary for the GSP project.6 The first phase of the GSP involved the digitization of the ministry, province, and city, while the second phase’s intent has been to integrate all three levels of public security networks by establishing the means to foster information sharing between the three levels.7 The project relies on information and communication technology (ICT) systems to enhance the ability of a unified command, rapid response, and coordinated effort to address supposedly the challenges of crime. In its early stages, it was characterized mostly by surveillance cameras paired with more efficient ways of sharing data within state bureaus. The GSP has grown significantly in size and sophistication since its founding. It now includes 416 million surveillance cameras around the country that utilize artificial intelligence (AI) facial recognition technology.8 These developments also include many ostensibly benign technologies like geolocation and storage servers that support social control. The Police Geographic, for example, is a geolocation platform made by Tianjin Troila Technology that offers the police real-time spatial visualization data.9 This project enables the representation of space into grids for surveillance and knowledge building to serve security objectives. Valentin Weber and Vasilis Ververis bolster this argument in research published in August 2021. Their report examines various technologies, including geolocation, which form part of a layered assemblage of surveillance systems that support the tracking of vehicles and people.10 The “safe city model,” or Ping an chengshi, evolved from the GSP.11 Simply put, it is “a computational model of urban planning that promises to optimize operational efficacy and promote economic growth by leveraging ICT systems.”12 It is a commodity sold by Huawei at home, but also offered across the Global South. Currently, the safe city relies on integrating data from multiple sources that include utility companies, retail stores, and formal banks. This biometric data then feeds databases run by public security bureaus, which utilize facial recognition tools. The centralized information systems are known as city brains, or Chengshi danao.13 These efforts in part bring together civil-commercial actors with the state for the sake of data-driven governance. Underlying the turn towards data-driven governance is Beijing’s belief in a scientific outlook on development, or kexue fazhan guan, a notion that assumes that technical interventions can numerically capture and abate social challenges, like crime.14 In 2016, President Xi maintained that legal and political constraints must be accompanied by the development of technology at home and abroad.15 A goal of its lobbying on multilateral institutions like the UN is the adoption of its conception of cyber sovereignty. Simply put, cyber sovereignty refers to respecting a nation’s right to choose the trajectory of its internet development and management.16 These lobbying efforts do not merely focus on technical norms and standards aimed at advancing network security, but also speak to the state’s right to control the flow of information within its borders. As it stands, Beijing’s notion of cyber sovereignty seeks to advocate for a country’s sovereign right to delimit and control data flows based on its domestic security interests. From this vantage point, states should discourage interference in the internal affairs of others. This privileging of the state offers legitimacy and cover to Beijing’s predilection towards delimiting and controlling online activity, but is also in contrast to Western commitments to cyber governance. While the United States and its allies “advocate for a more open, free, and multistakeholder approach, which provides open platforms for private actors and civil society organizations, China wishes to promote a complete counterapproach that asserts the interests of the government over non-state actors.”17 China’s domestic environment has nurtured a tech industry that supports the state’s aims to monitor, censor, and condition public opinion. The Golden Shield Project, which is popularly referred to as the “Great Firewall of China,” is the best illustration of this project. An initiative managed by the Ministry of Public Security, which crucially relies on filtering and censorship technologies that operate alongside domestic law that limits and seeks to curate online discourse. Margaret Roberts, in her work titled “Censored: Distraction and Diversion Inside China’s Great Firewall,” offers a systematic analysis that demonstrates how state agencies have created social media accounts that flood the internet with approved state media content that seeks to influence public opinion.18 The state’s attempt to control discourses also includes a desire to influence international opinion about China. Adam Segal’s in-depth 2020 essay describes how Beijing promotes cyber sovereignty, or wangluo zhuquan, as an organizing principle to prevent the flow of online information that threatens domestic political stability, foster technological supremacy and independence from the United States, and counter US global influence.19 China increasingly acts in accordance with its policy of cyber sovereignty. In 2017, the government told companies like Tencent, a giant internet-based platform and company, to shut down websites that host content deemed as socially and politically threatening.20 Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, made changes to its platform in 2018 to allow government censors to tag posts as unsubstantiated rumors.21 This corporate complicity has made and scaled up surveillance. Likewise, mass surveillance practices in Xinjiang—a matter that Beijing has claimed to be a domestic affair that is beyond international critique—has several corporate actors involved. For instance, H3C has also developed an internet protocol (IP) telephone network for the Xinjiang Public Security authorities.22 State agencies employ a multisource and layered surveillance system that uses mobile apps, biometric collection, artificial intelligence, and big data, among other means, to monitor and control thirteen million Turkic Muslims. State procurement of public security technology and innovation policy is driving China’s surveillance ecosystem. Surveillance tools scale the party-state’s means to conduct surveillance operations on targeted populations that are presumed to be threats to social stability, which result in legal and extralegal means to address the supposed challenge to security. Chinese tech start-ups are seeking to meet the demands of the country’s security services. Many cybersecurity firms in China focus on vulnerability research, threat detection, and security intelligence products, which they sell to the state.23 While these firms mostly rely on Chinese venture capital, they have grown to service clients globally. For example, Pangu Lab is a cybersecurity research team under Pwnzen Infotech that focuses on advanced security research in offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. Pwnzen Infotech has the backing of Qihoo 360, the largest provider of internet and mobile security products in China.24 Pangu Lab aims to be at the forefront of vulnerability research and to offer insights into the offensive and defensive techniques necessary to combat potential infiltration and exploitation. Pangu Lab founder, Han Zhengguang, is well-known in the Chinese cybersecurity industry for cracking the iPhone.25 According to Han, Pangu Lab conducts security research on iOS. Moreover, they have discovered hundreds of zero-day security vulnerabilities in mainstream operating systems and popular applications, including Android and other leading mobile operating systems.26 Pangu Lab, like many new Chinese cybersecurity research firms, has connections to more established tech firms, but also forms part of an ecosystem of smaller firms and start-ups increasingly used by security services to conduct defensive and offensive cyber operations.27 Drawing attention to the development of China’s cybersecurity industry also means uncovering China’s national cyber ambitions, which are partly contingent on the rapidly advancing sector. Companies operating in this space are increasingly at the forefront of their respective fields, and their insights and products are sold to public security services in China.28 Party-state cyber capacities depend on private-public cooperation, where the state procures interception and intrusion technologies. Unlike the Israeli NSO Group, which claims to only sell products to state actors, Chinese start-ups like Pangu offer products to state and non-state actors. They justify their business model by pointing to the need for cybersecurity, but also how their vulnerability research allows for better software.29 Many tech firms tailor their services to meet the demands of China’s security services. For example, Chinese companies like Haimeng, Jin Ruan, Ruitec, and Goldeweb have developed products to support the police in predictive policing and the management of targeted populations perceived to be threats to social stability.30 Arcvideo, like Megvii, also helps equip public security services and has established relationships with the Beijing Criminal Investigation Corps, the Wuhan Public Security Bureau, and six other local security organs.31 Megvii offers a range of digital solutions, which includes portable video equipment, covert video tracking capabilities, and AI-based analytics software. Western companies like IBM, Intel, Cisco, and Oracle have also provided hardware and software used in China’s surveillance network. Oracle sold the software to Liaoning police, which has enhanced their tracking of key objects, events, and people to better identify potential suspects.32 Scholars have also noted that other Chinese security services—including the Xinjiang police force—use Oracle’s data security service.33 Chinese leaders have criticized Chinese cyber researchers for doing work outside of China. Indeed, they have implored them to stay in China in order for the government to realize the strategic value of software vulnerabilities.34 As a result, Zhou Hongyi, the chairman and CEO of Qihoo 360, delisted the company from the New York Stock Exchange in 2016. Qihoo 360 then relisted in Shanghai in 2018 in part to qualify for Chinese government and military contracts.35 Likewise, Chen Xie, the CEO of Tophant, has claimed that Chinese firms dealing with cloud security, data security, zero trust, and privacy, are more likely to receive contracts and funding from Beijing.36 Megvii, a partner of Chinese public security authorities, garnered sixty percent of its revenues from smart city contracts in 2020.37 Additionally, such access to mass population data enables firms like Megvii to better train their algorithms to identify human faces.38 As such, given the financial incentives to work with the CCP, companies have little interest or limited reasons not to develop and supply technologies for public security officials. Private firms within the technology sector, particularly in the cybersecurity space, are increasingly offering their insights and services to the Chinese government, even as they assert ignorance about their collaborative ventures with the state.39 While encouraging the private-public partnerships that have capacitated its cyber power, the Chinese government has also created a more restrictive environment for researchers. Chinese cyber researchers are now effectively banned from participating in international hacking events and competitions, which they once dominated.40 If researchers wish to participate in an international competition, they must ask for permission, which the state rarely grants.41 Additionally, they must submit their knowledge of software vulnerabilities to security services before attending any international event, giving Chinese security officials a comparative advantage over the United States concerning defensive or offensive hacking operations. While direct engagement with the private and public sectors varies between firms, Chinese technology firms operate under a more restrictive legal environment. The  2016 cybersecurity law, 2021 data security law, and 2017 national intelligence law form a series of laws that obligate firms to cooperate with state security organs when requested.42 Lucero contends that this environment of increasing rigidity has exacerbated a bureaucratic architecture that prioritizes political stability over economic efficiency.43 Such a move has reportedly resulted “increased centralization and ideological control with fear and paralysis.”44 Accordingly, these rules establish obligations for firms to cooperate with party-state organs by sharing data that is believed to threaten or promote national security interests. Certainly, it appears that these changes in recent years to the Chinese system occur without any legal recourse or administrative means to decline requests made by state security officials.45 Pointedly, the shift towards public stability and security as the primary objective of the party-state has led to a more strict environment for corporations. For example, the new intelligence law requires companies to contribute to government intelligence work by sharing their data when requested by security officials. Simultaneously,  this change is unfolding alongside progress being made in personal consumer rights in China.  Two recent legal statements challenge this view of a more restrictive legal environment.46 The first is by the Beijing-based Zhong Lun law firm, their statement was submitted to the Federal Communications Commission during its proceedings regarding concerns around Huawei. At this time, Huawei representatives were sending documents to state officials and organs around the world in support of company as a safe and reliable vendor. The “Zhong Lun declaration” discusses statutory laws passed by China’s Standing Committee, and crucially contends that the current national cybersecurity law, national intelligence law, and anti-terrorism law do not necessarily require tech firms to cooperate with Beijing or obligate them to offer backdoor access to data. This position is further supported by the second statement made by the British law firm Clifford Chance, which was employed by Huawei to issue a legal opinion supposedly in concurrence with the Zhong Lun declaration. Despite these notable interventions, it is a misstep to simply focus on what Chinese law says about the party-state and what it can demand of firms. It is more salient, I argue, to know what the government can actually do, regardless of what the law says. These interventions on behalf of Huawei assume that Beijing is meaningfully constrained by law. In this light, scholars, like Donald Clarke, contend these two legal statements offer a misleading conclusion. Indeed, the arguments do not ameliorate US national security concerns.47 Because while discussing some key features of the intelligence law, the Zhong Lun declaration focuses on a limited subset of mandatory rules and crucially ignores a number of other rules that ask for cooperation. The declaration contends that companies can simply decline state security official requests, and even take action if their legal rights have been violated, companies can pursue remedy through administrative review and through the court system.48 This view implies that there are judicial checks to state excesses. However, there is as yet no evidence of such a case resulting in an enterprise or citizen receiving this remedy as a result of such violations. These rights asserted in the Zhong Lun declaration—and supposedly respected—are not clearly defined and stated. For these reasons, it is unlikely that the CCP is meaningfully and substantially constrained by law.49 The party-state utilizes all-encompassing surveillance practices that mobilize the national CCTV network and cyber researchers to bolster its cyber power. This policy, in part, relies on a more rigid regulatory environment. Strategies, ranging from buying company shares to requiring the establishment of party committees within firms, allow for state-overseen enterprises. Weber and Ververis contend that the procurement of Chinese surveillance tools may expose Western individuals to privacy risks, as the backdoors used for domestic surveillance in China are exported to foreign markets, unless the tech firms choose to sell a more secure version of public security technologies for international customers.50 Researchers like Honovich have unearthed and forewarned the various cybersecurity vulnerabilities in Hikvision cameras.51 Currently, there is no empirical evidence from the ground that demonstrates the systematic coordination between Beijing and Hikvision in the purposeful theft of personal data. This concern, however, remains an escalating vulnerability. For example, African Union’s (AU) staffers discovered that China-based hackers, Bronze President, had “rigged a cluster of servers in the basement of an administrative annex to steal surveillance videos from across the AU’s sprawling campus in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital.”52 As such, it is paramount to promote and advance supply chain integrity given the real risk for designed backdoors in hardware or software. In addition to aiming to realize cyber power ambitions at home, China’s drive for tech and cybersecurity leadership extends globally. Research from Steven Feldstein found that Chinese companies supply AI surveillance technology in sixty-three countries, thirty-six of which have signed onto China’s Belt and Road Initiative.53 Accordingly, these technologies, developed for the sake of the GSP program, are now exported across the globe. Much of the establishment of surveillance programs is through third parties and subsidiaries of Chinese companies.54 To be clear, the selling of digital monitoring tools and cyber capability technologies is not unique to Chinese vendors. Many non-Chinese enterprises, including Western firms, are involved in the sale of cyber capabilities and surveillance tools.55 This focus on Chinese technology does not aim to obfuscate the broader transnational market of digital surveillance tools, which indubitably includes American actors. Rather, the paper illustrates how the procurement of Chinese technology appears to be a result of both Chinese supply and local demand factors. What is unique about Beijing is how it goes about promoting public security systems in the Global South. The party-state utilizes multilateral institutions like the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), an emerging markets group, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) to promote its surveillance platforms across the Global South.56 Particularly, through FOCAC and the China-Africa Defense Forum, China has signed resolutions to increase cooperation in areas like counterterrorism,  safe city projects, and cybersecurity.57 China also supplements this promise with commitments to offer finance, technical assistance, and training to African governments on topics ranging from digital forensic techniques to cybersecurity.58 These efforts reflect Beijing’s aims to influence international norms through multilateral institutions, which further normalize and seek to legitimize its surveillance practices at home. These trends are particularly prevalent in a handful of African countries. The China-Africa Internet Development and Cooperation Forum held in August 2021 offers an example of China’s aims to implement a joint China-Africa partnership to advance digitization and promote its notion of cyber sovereignty.59 Additionally, Beijing’s efforts to shape cybersecurity standards and regulations in part garner legitimacy from its digital development aid and projects in Africa. The proliferation of surveillance technology has, unsurprisingly, had clear effects on law enforcement practices. For example, the use of Chinese surveillance technologies in South Africa has risen largely in tandem with police-to-police training and cooperation—like the 2018 South African delegation tour of Shanghai’s Public Security Bureaus to learn how to improve policing techniques.60 Similarly, the Botswana Police Services enlisted Huawei to install 500 surveillance cameras in Gaborone and Francistown, including inside commercial buildings, as part of a two-year deal with the company’s Safe City Project.61 Utilizing ICT systems and services, the Kenyan government aims to foster a safe city project where digital surveillance systems are incorporated into Nairobi’s city infrastructure to optimize development and security ambitions. Working with Huawei and Safaricom, the government established the first African safe city in Nairobi, which connected 200 high-definition traffic surveillance cameras and 1800 high-definition cameras.62 What is more, these integrated platforms include a high-speed private broadband network and command center for the National Police Service, which supports over 9000 police officers in 195 police stations. Through these digital surveillance systems, the safe city platform aims to meet several service delivery demands, including real-time surveillance, evidence collection, and video browsing that purportedly support accelerated police response, recovery missions, and crime prevention. Namely, Huawei’s safe city platforms are promoted as solutions for crime and rising terroristic threats. Governments in the Global South are procuring their services on the grounds to expand their surveillance capacities to address growing trepidations around crime and terrorism. Yet, in part, due to the dearth of publicly available data, the benefits of the safe city platforms are difficult to verify and appear grossly overstated by Huawei.63 According to them, crime rates decreased by 46 percent in areas supported by their platform in 2014 to 2015.64 However, the Eastern African nation’s police services report lower reduction rates in crime during those years.65 Unfortunately, Nairobi and Mombasa, the two cities supported by Huawei’s safe city platforms have seen an increase in reported crime between 2017 and 2018. While China’s surveillance system is confined to its national borders, the companies that make its surveillance state possible are now actively selling their tools abroad. Given the growing influence of these firms and the spread of digital surveillance tools, scholars like Feldstein contend that the party-state is not only supporting the proliferation of digital public security technologies, but also enabling the rise of authoritarianism. This kind of argument, I contend presumes a coordinated effort between the party-state and  technology firms as a way to export Chinese norms and repressive practices overseas. Indeed, while this argument draws attention to Chinese push factors, it ignores local demand features. Moreover, it lacks robust empirical evidence from the ground to establish the consequences of Beijing’s promotional efforts.66 For instance, the use of surveillance tools in Kenya, and across Africa, is supposedly a means to improve service delivery and law enforcement. Accordingly, technologies are adopted in order to address such structural and political challenges.67 The extent of technology and regulation diffusion, and indeed whether it undercuts civil liberties, is greatly contingent on the political and legal environment of the recipient African country. We are yet to observe party-state solutions for public instability being promoted in the Global South by Beijing. Currently, Huawei’s safe city technologies are marketed as solutions to local concerns around crime and terror. Indeed, China’s active “push” of domestic surveillance technologies is a critical force in shaping African surveillance ecosystems. As such, highlighting how Beijing leverages local demand factors to advance its own geopolitical interests should not be viewed as an attempt to downplay African state agency in determining the application of public security technologies. For these reasons, Africa, and other regions, must be carefully studied both on their terms and as well as places enmeshed in wider relations. The companion report to this issue brief will focus on the key “pull factors” from African countries and their significance for US interests. More to the point, we must engender even-handed studies that demonstrate the degree to which local agency is shaping relations between Africa-China while also underscoring the interplay between local political commitments and Chinese state ambitions.68 This more proportional analysis seeks to expand our understanding and offers insights into the perennial consequences of Beijing’s growing cyber power on the global stage. 1 Bulelani Jili, The Rise of Chinese Surveillance Technology in Africa. 2 President Xi Jinping, “China Must Evolve from a Large Internet Nation to a Powerful Internet Nation,”  习近平:把我国从网络大国建设成 为网络强国, Xinhuanet, February 27, 2014, http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2014- 02/27/c_119538788.htm.

China’s high-tech surveillance technologies and systems employ advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) to process and analyze massive amounts of data collected from facial recognition, DNA sampling, biometrics, GPS, ubiquitous, high-resolution CCTV cameras, intrusive mobile phone apps, desktop computer software, smart TVs, and drones. However, these high-tech capabilities are also combined with old-fashioned networks of informants, a constant and invasive police presence, outposts and patrols, all integrated with massive computerized databases. “[China has] adopted the most pervasive surveillance system in the world, and it not only uses new tech to surveil but to link people to their police record, their social information, their name, and their identity number,” said James Andrew Lewis, a technology expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS). “It’s the combination of big data, facial recognition, and pervasive surveillance that’s made it the most intrusive thing that anyone has ever seen.” This surveillance system is composed primarily of three tracks: 1) Massive, unprecedented collection of personal data, 2) near total surveillance via technical and human means, and 3) data analysis and management via advanced AI and military-style coordination operations. The final goal is a sophisticated national database allowing security forces to track, analyze and control every individual in China in real, or near real time. While many aspects of these surveillance systems are being employed throughout China, Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China’s northwest, home of most of the country’s Uyghur Muslim population, has been serving as the testing ground or laboratory for some of the most intrusive and repressive techniques. In 2017 President Xi Jinping declared he was creating a “wall of steel” around the region. Once proven in Xinjiang, these surveillance systems are often rolled out to other regions of China. Fergus Ryan, an analyst and China expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said that the technology has been deployed as “part of Beijing’s repression of the Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other ethnic minorities” and that Xinjiang was “a major testing ground for these types of surveillance technologies”. China has become the nefarious global leader in collecting extremely sensitive and personal data from its citizens. According to Human Rights Watch, Chinese authorities in Xinjiang are collecting a full range of biometrics including DNA samples, fingerprints, iris scans, and blood types of all residents in the region between the ages of 12 and 65 in order to build a region-wide biometric database. This data collection is done primarily via a specially designed mobile app while DNA and blood types are being collected through a free annual physical exams program called “Physicals for All.” In 2016, Xinjiang police bureaus also began collecting residents’ voice samples for a national voice database that could be used, for example, to identify any voice during recorded phone conversations. For people designated as “focus personnel” or “key individuals,” full biometrics samples must be taken regardless of age. These “important persons to be controlled” are those people the Chinese authorities consider threatening to regime stability – and their families — to have usually members of ethnic minorities such as Uyghurs, and “illegal” religious groups. According to Human Rights Watch, this biometric collection scheme is detailed in an official document called “The [Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous] Region Working Guidelines on the Accurate Registration and Verification of Population” (“The Population Registration Program”). As Bitter Winter previously reported, a major part of China’s data collection effort also includes the expansive, dragnet-style “Operation Knocking on Doors” launched nationwide in early 2017. This operation sends police officers to investigate and photograph religious believers under false pretexts, part of a broader surveillance system to specifically track religious people nationwide. The operation collects information on the activities of religious groups listed as xie jiao and conducts networked surveillance of each believer. Data is stored in dedicated computers of the Domestic Security Protection Bureau. Investigators also search for evidence that individuals are promoting religion. If found, further investigation is pursued. These investigations then lead to comprehensive, non-stop surveillance of the individuals through projects “Sharp Eyes” and “Skynet,” as well as other electronic monitoring systems.  As noted by the Los Angeles Times, China has installed 176 million public and private surveillance cameras for its 1.4 billion people, including some on every block in its capital, Beijing. However, China plans to have as many as 626 million cameras installed nationwide by 2020. As more CCTV cameras are installed in rural areas and they increasingly incorporate advanced facial and the latest “gait” (walking styles) recognition, China is will soon become the world’s most monitored society. According to a Radio Free Asia report, the company behind the Sharp Eyes claims to have developed the platform systems using home televisions and smartphones to push video surveillance into people’s homes. Beginning in 2016, Xinjiang police also started using hand-held or desktop scanning devices that can break into smartphones and extract and analyze all information contained on it. These surveillance technologies are now quietly spreading across China. Reuters reported that this technology is now encroaching into cities like Shanghai and Beijing. Residents in Xinjiang are also required to install GPS tracking devices in their vehicles, and those who refuse are not allowed to buy fuel for their vehicles. Local authorities have even set up facial recognition systems that would alert them when targeted individuals moved more than 1,000 feet beyond their home or workplace. Additionally, since 2017 Xinjiang residents are being required to install an app called Jingwangweishi, “Web Cleaning Soldier” to help authorities monitor cell phones. All Chinese residents are also increasingly being surveilled by the state via a backdoor in the vastly popular social media app WeChat. With data collected on a person’s every aspect and movement, artificial intelligence is needed to process the vast volume of information for hundreds of millions of Chinese. AI “can trace patterns, map relationships, and note deviations. For house church leaders, this makes it difficult to organize, secretly hold services, or inform outsiders when persecution occurs,” according to Dean Cheng, an expert on China at the Heritage Foundation. To manage and analyze the massive amounts of information from so many sources, Chinese authorities are implementing a military-style “Integrated Joint Operations Platform” to aggregate data about people that “detects deviations from what authorities deem ‘normal,” reports Human Rights Watch. The program generates lists of subjects for police to round up and question; many are detained and then sent to transformation through education camps. Integrated joint operations is a new People’s Liberation Army (PLA) doctrine that depends on a hi-tech C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) “system of systems.” China’s application of this military doctrine, and technology to civilian policing demonstrates the extent to which policing in Xinjiang is being militarized. Ultimately all this surveillance and data collection is designed for one purpose. While Chinese authorities claim the unprecedented surveillance, tracking and monitoring is used to prevent crime, improve health or other benign purposes, it’s overarching goal is to control and repress the people, especially the Uyghurs and religious groups. This was shockingly highlighted recently when a Dutch cyber expert discovered a massive unsecured Chinese online database that showed China is using what is being called a “Muslim Tracker” to closely monitor over 2.5 million people, primarily Uyghurs in Xinjiang Region. Australia’s ABC News reported that Victor Gevers, a researcher with GDI.foundation, found names, identification card numbers, birth dates, employers and locations on an unprotected database run by SenseNets, a Chinese company contracted by the Chinese police. Reports showed that the database included details of 2,565,724 people, and 6.7 million geographical coordinates showing the locations of each of these citizens over the last 24 hours. According to Gevers, the data was tagged with descriptions such as mosque, hotel, internet cafe, restaurant, police station, and other places where surveillance cameras were often found. Locations were apparently recorded as individuals passed cameras in fixed positions that provide a video feed for facial recognition. “This insecure face recognition/personal verification solution is built and operated for only one goal,” he wrote on Twitter: “It’s a ‘Muslim tracker’ funded by Chinese authorities in the province of Xinjiang to keep track of Uyghur Muslims.” By 2020 China plans to use these comprehensive surveillance systems to track all Chinese. However, the Chinese may not limit their monitoring of people to China. As reported by Bitter Winter, the recent arrest in Vancouver, Canada of Meng Wanzhou, deputy chairwoman of the board and chief financial officer of China’s largest private company, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd has heightened concerns that China intends to spread its surveillance techniques globally, well beyond China through companies like Huawei; even potentially hijacking the next generation worldwide 5G network for these purposes. To make the Orwellian picture complete in China, western technological giants such as Apple are complicit with China in its repression by censoring human rights and religious liberty websites and apps. Also, in January 2019 the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) launched a new app available for both Apple and Android platforms, “Xi Study (Xue Xi) Strong Nation”, available from the website xuexi.cn. This app, provided by the Propaganda and Public Opinion Research Center of the Central Propaganda Department of the CCP, is mandatory for all CCP cadres and members. As noted in Bitter Winter, the app’s name includes a word game in Chinese. “Xi” is the President’s last name but is also the second character in the Chinese word xuexi, which means “to study.” The implication is that the study of the President’s word is the most important study of them all. Apple, which censors other apps, quickly obliged the CCP, as did other platforms; and the “Xi Study” app is now up and running at full speed. In China, “Orwellian dystopia” may be too tame a term to describe it’s ever-expanding digital despotism. Correction (March 22, 2019): The name of the company that developed the Sharp Eyes technology was misquoted in the original text. It is not Bell New Vision Co. but Guangdong-based Aebell Technology Corporation.

Internet concerts and live entertainment became popular during the pandemic. A new regulation puts them under strict control. They are coming and they may soon dominate the market. But they are more than vehicles and may transmit sensitive data to China outside any control. Connections between phones rather than through the Internet are used by protesters to elude surveillance. New rules will make this impossible—with a little help from Apple. To avoid being banned in the West, Hikvision, the CCP-owned giant video surveillance company, claimed in 2022 it had stopped offering its racist video analytics systems. It was a lie.
